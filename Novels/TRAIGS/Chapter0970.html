        <p>"Hmm..."<br><br>Raon received the letter Glenn handed him with both hands. Though it clearly contained only paper, it felt strangely heavy.<br><br>"Is the Five Kings Conference being held again?"<br><br>"With the fall of the Black Tower, the balance of the Five Kings and Five Demons—no, the Five Kings and Four Demons has been disrupted. Naturally, we must hold a conference to celebrate our victory and demonstrate our strength."<br><br>Glenn's cold eyes glinted as he mentioned that the Five Kings Conference could create an even bigger rift among the remaining Demons.<br><br>"You're planning to draw the neutral forces who haven't chosen a side to our faction, aren't you?"<br><br>Raon clicked his tongue briefly as he looked at Glenn.<br><br>"Correct. As expected, you've caught on."<br><br>Glenn nodded approvingly.<br><br>"There are still neutral forces that haven't decided between the Five Kings and the Demons. Countless unaffiliated Martial Artists and Magicians exist. This Five Kings Conference is an important event to bring such individuals to our side."<br><br>He slowly closed and opened his eyes, saying that this conference could determine the outcome of the upcoming war.<br><br>"It's certainly an opportunity we can't miss."<br><br>Raon nodded as he gazed at the moonlit lake.<br><br>'If they're holding it, we must make it a success no matter what.'<br><br>If they could increase the Five Kings' forces through this conference, they could lead the upcoming war with overwhelming advantage. As Glenn said, it was an extremely important event.<br><br>"But is it alright for me to attend such an important conference?"<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he looked at the five stars engraved on the envelope.<br><br>"The reason this Five Kings Conference is being held is thanks to you, Raon."<br><br>Glenn smiled faintly as he grasped Raon's shoulder.<br><br>"If you hadn't slain the Black Tower Master, this event would never have taken place. If you can't go, no one can."<br><br>He nodded slightly, saying that the conference itself was being held because of Raon's achievements.<br><br>"Besides, the others want to see you too."<br><br>Glenn smiled with a sense of pride, mentioning that the leaders of the Five Kings also wanted to meet Raon.<br><br>"Well, I guess I should go then."<br><br>Raon nodded while rubbing the back of his neck. Hearing such words made him feel a bit embarrassed.<br><br>"Raon, you didn't just bring down the Black Tower; you shattered the very structure of the Five Kings and Five Demons. It's something even I couldn't do, so have confidence."<br><br>Glenn raised a finger, saying it was an achievement that would mark history.<br><br>-How grandiose!<br><br>Wrath wrinkled his nose, seemingly displeased.<br><br>-Wasn't it all achieved with this king's help?<br><br>He clung to Raon's shoulder, insisting that after hearing such praise, Raon must buy him ice cream.<br><br>"I didn't take down the Black Tower Master alone."<br><br>Raon shook his head, brushing off Wrath.<br><br>"Without Chamber, it would have been impossible."<br><br>It wasn't just Chamber. Without Wrath, Gluttony, and Lust, he and the Light Wind Palace swordsmen would all have been buried in that hellish darkness.<br><br>"You're still humble."<br><br>"No, it's not humility. I'm stating a fact. I can't defeat the leaders of the Five Kings and Four Demons right now."<br><br>Raon lowered his calm gaze as he said he couldn't win yet.<br><br>"'Right now,' huh..."<br><br>Glenn stroked his beard, slightly curling the corners of his mouth.<br><br>"That sounds like you'll reach that level soon."<br><br>"Of course I have to rise. I have a lot to do."<br><br>Raon nodded calmly, saying he would definitely stand at the same level as the leaders of the Five Kings and Four Demons.<br><br>"Hah..."<br><br>Glenn covered his face with a trembling hand.<br><br>'Well done. Well done indeed!'<br><br>To think he would become this admirable. Raon had always shown a humble attitude. It was almost excessive, so Glenn thought he would try to give credit to others this time too, but hidden in that action was a clear confidence that he could become stronger. It seemed his mindset had changed after visiting the Room of Self.<br><br>"Head of House?"<br><br>"Ah, it's nothing."<br><br>Glenn quickly wiped his slightly damp hand at Raon's call.<br><br>"Where is this conference being held?"<br><br>"Balkar."<br><br>"It's because of Chamber, isn't it?"<br><br>Raon sighed briefly, recalling Chamber's condition when he last saw her.<br><br>"Yes. She hasn't recovered her strength yet."<br><br>Glenn clicked his tongue, saying that Chamber was still in rehabilitation.<br><br>"Ah, then is King Lecross alright?"<br><br>Hearing Chamber's name reminded him of King Lecross's condition after being attacked by Derus.<br><br>"He's fine. His injuries haven't fully healed, but he hasn't lost his martial prowess."<br><br>Glenn nodded, saying that King Lecross could move sufficiently.<br><br>"That's a relief."<br><br>Raon lowered his eyebrows, recalling the face of the kind King Lecross.<br><br>'Come to think of it, our Five Kings side isn't in good shape either.'<br><br>Chamber and Ogram had lost their martial prowess, and Lecross was severely injured. Currently, only Glenn and the Mage Tower Master Larian were unharmed.<br><br>'Of course, the Demons aren't in a normal state either.'<br><br>Derus, the White Blood Religion, and Eden were still intact, but the Holy Sword Alliance was already walking a different path from them. They might not be able to help the Five Kings, but they would never side with the Demons.<br><br>-There's that guy, you know.<br><br>Wrath nodded, perching on top of Raon's head.<br><br>-The madman who gouged out his own eyes in his obsession with the sword.<br><br>'The former Leader of the Holy Sword Alliance...'<br><br>Raon bit his lip, recalling the most grotesque swordsman.<br><br>'He's definitely a problem.'<br><br>The Holy Sword Alliance Leader had promised not to touch the Holy Sword Alliance, but he hadn't said he wouldn't participate in the war.<br><br>'He'll definitely come.'<br><br>He was a monster who lived solely to cross swords with Glenn. He would surely involve himself in the war, even if it meant siding with the Demons.<br><br>"You don't need to worry about Zieghart during the conference."<br><br>Glenn smiled calmly, seemingly misinterpreting Raon's stern expression.<br><br>"Chamber and the Mage Tower Master have developed a new magic that allows them to return to the main building immediately. It might be figured out after being used once, but for now, it's safe."<br><br>He clenched his fingertips, saying they wouldn't allow a situation like when King Lecross was attacked.<br><br>"That's good to hear."<br><br>It seemed there would be no risk of the main building being attacked like King Lecross.<br><br>"So, will you go?"<br><br>"Of course I should."<br><br>Now there was no reason to refuse, and it didn't seem like a bad use of his reputation and strength to draw in neutral forces.<br><br>"You've thought well."<br><br>Glenn lowered his hand, saying they would depart in a week.<br><br>"Head of House. I have one question..."<br><br>"Call me grandfather."<br><br>He slightly raised his shoulders, saying this was no longer an official matter.<br><br>-This old geezer is truly annoying.<br><br>Wrath shook his head, saying he was fed up.<br><br>"Grandfather. How is Aunt doing?"<br><br>Raon looked at Glenn, recalling Alice as he had last seen her.<br><br>"After returning from Mirtan Village, she went to the main building and hasn't come back..."<br><br>As Raon had expected, Alice had gone to Mirtan Village and retrieved the cursed sword. However, she hadn't returned since going to the main building, which worried him.<br><br>"She's doing so well it's troublesome."<br><br>Glenn slightly lowered his eyelids, saying it was exhausting.<br><br>"If you're worried, why don't you go see her yourself?"<br><br>He turned his back immediately, as if suggesting they go now.<br><br>"No, she'll be sleeping, so tomorrow or later..."<br><br>"No."<br><br>Glenn shook his head firmly, as if to say absolutely not.<br><br>"She'll still be awake. In fact..."<br><br>He smiled and raised two fingers.<br><br>"Both of them."<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>Raon followed Glenn towards the Head of House's training ground.<br><br>'Hmm...?'<br><br>A barrier that erased sound and impact was set up around the training ground. It was quiet, but it seemed someone was inside.<br><br>"From here on, suppress your presence. It might disturb their training."<br><br>Glenn entered the training ground through a side door that, unlike usual, made no sound.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Raon nodded and quietly crossed the open door into the training ground. A series of thunderous sounds, as if the earth was collapsing, erupted as soon as he set foot in the training ground. Turning his gaze towards the source of the sound, he saw Karoon and Alice thrusting their swords at each other's throats.<br><br>The swords wrapped in aura clashed violently, causing blue sparks to erupt around the training ground.<br><br>Karoon and Alice continued to unleash fierce sword strikes towards each other, not backing down even as their flesh was being torn by each other's powerful aura.<br><br>'Are they sparring?'<br><br>Raon examined the black sword in Alice's hand amidst the magnificent waves of clashing transcendent auras.<br><br>'So she did obtain that black sword.'<br><br>He had expected her to go to Mirtan Village to get that sword when she left Federick's mansion. She seemed quite accustomed to using the power contained in the sword.<br><br>'Are they venting their pent-up emotions?'<br><br>Raon let out a sigh as he observed Karoon and Alice's sparring.<br><br>'Why are they fighting so fiercely?'<br><br>Karoon and Alice were not just sparring; they were thrusting their swords at each other's hearts as if facing a mortal enemy. They were wielding their swords with all their might, seemingly unaware that he and Glenn had arrived, as if they truly intended to kill each other.<br><br>The two continued to swing their swords until their arms and legs were completely drained of strength. After about an hour, the endless exchange of sword strikes slowly began to subside.<br><br>Karoon and Alice dropped their swords as if they had been waiting for this moment and collapsed on the spot.<br><br>"You're too stable."<br><br>Alice narrowed her brows as she looked at Karoon.<br><br>"You should sometimes move provocatively and aggressively to create variables, but you're so stable that your moves are predictable."<br><br>She snorted, saying he was easy to deal with.<br><br>"I'll give you advice too. Sister, you're fighting purely on instinct, without using your head at all."<br><br>Karoon let out a deflated laugh, as if finding it pathetic.<br><br>"Fighting on instinct isn't necessarily bad, but if you don't use your head at all, you're no different from a beast. No, you're worse than a beast."<br><br>He too firmly pointed out Alice's shortcomings, returning the favor.<br><br>"I am thinking while fighting!"<br><br>Alice frowned, insisting that she had been swinging her sword while thinking hard.<br><br>"Are you just not smart? If so, there's no hope..."<br><br>Karoon waved his hand provocatively.<br><br>"You're too scared to fight! You don't have the courage to enter my range, do you?"<br><br>Alice glared at Karoon, gritting her teeth.<br><br>"Shall we go at it again? As fiercely as a beast."<br><br>"Sure. I'll kill you this time! While thinking!"<br><br>Karoon and Alice immediately stood up and clashed swords again. Though their strength and aura had diminished significantly, a new flow and vitality were emerging between their swords that wasn't there before.<br><br>"This is..."<br><br>Raon swallowed dryly and turned to look at Glenn.<br><br>"It's symbiotic training. A method where Martial Artists of similar skill levels realize each other's strengths and weaknesses and grow together."<br><br>Glenn nodded, saying that although Karoon was stronger, they were moving in sync with each other to some extent.<br><br>"Symbiotic training..."<br><br>Raon clicked his tongue.<br><br>'I'm a bit envious of this.'<br><br>He felt a pang of envy at the idea of being able to grow together by clashing at full strength with an opponent of similar skill.<br><br>'Who would be a match for me now?'<br><br>By his estimation, only the Thespian Emperor. If he broadened his scope a bit, perhaps the Demon Slaying Spear might be possible.<br><br>"Do you know why those two have been training until now?"<br><br>Glenn turned the finger that had been pointing at Karoon and Alice towards Raon.<br><br>"It's all because of you."<br><br>"...Because of me?"<br><br>His mouth fell open at the unexpected answer.<br><br>"Karoon doesn't want to be left behind by you. He's determined to catch up no matter what. And Alice wants to repay what she's received from you."<br><br>Glenn smiled, saying that the reason Karoon and Alice were training until now was all because of him.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Raon silently watched Karoon and Alice. Seeing the two swinging their swords while shedding blood and sweat made his heart pound as if struck by a drum.<br><br>-To not give up even after seeing your growth, he's more impressive than this king expected.<br><br>Wrath let out a dry laugh as he looked at Karoon.<br><br>-I thought he was unremarkable until now, but I've come to see him in a new light.<br><br>He nodded heavily, saying Karoon wasn't just Shitty eye's father for nothing.<br><br>'Indeed.'<br><br>Raon bit his lip as he watched Karoon displaying refined swordsmanship even while sweating profusely.<br><br>'It's the first time someone hasn't given up and kept following me.'<br><br>To be honest, he was cheating in this world.<br><br>Wrath's abilities and traits, the Ring of Fire, and the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation. Each of these overpowered abilities harmonized to bring him to Transcendence in his twenties.<br><br>Seeing such impossible growth would make anyone lose heart and give up, but Karoon didn't fall. He got right back up and started running. Raon felt both admiration and shock at the sight of him training through the night with Alice to catch up.<br><br>'The same goes for Aunt.'<br><br>Alice hadn't fully sorted out her feelings yet. It was incredibly gratifying to see her standing there, wanting to help him, despite both her body and mind being exhausted.<br><br>"..."<br><br>After watching Karoon and Alice's sparring for a while, Raon slowly stood up.<br><br>"Are you leaving already?"<br><br>"My hands are itching."<br><br>He smiled gently as he grasped the hilt of the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>"I need to climb higher so those two don't catch up to me."<br><br>Vowing never to lose, he headed towards the exit of the training ground.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Glenn leaned back in his chair and let out a deep laugh.<br><br>"To be blessed with both filial children and grandchildren in my twilight years. Of course, it's all thanks to you."<br><br>He smiled warmly at Raon's retreating back.<br><br>'Thank you, Raon.'<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>A week later. Raon stood on the platform in his black uniform, looking down at the Light Wind Palace swordsmen.<br><br>"Today, we're going to Balkar, the center of the continent where the Five Kings Conference is being held."<br><br>He nodded to the Light Wind Palace swordsmen who were emanating a sharp aura like statues of knights.<br><br>"This conference could change the course of the upcoming war. We, the Light Wind Palace, have the honor of escorting the Head of House to such an important place."<br><br>Raon raised a finger as he exhaled softly.<br><br>"As you know, there are many who don't believe we completely destroyed the Black Tower. They might be puppets of the Demons or just paranoid, but trying to convince such people would be a waste of time."<br><br>Raon took a step forward on the platform. Golden flames like demon wings bloomed behind his back.<br><br>"Show them our strength. Prove to those who doubt who we are and what we've accomplished with force. Imprint the three words 'Light Wind Palace' into their minds."<br><br>"We receive your command!"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen placed their hands on their left chests, over their hearts, and raised their voices loud enough to shake the ground.<br><br>"Then let's depart."<br><br>Raon descended from the platform. He passed through the center of the Light Wind Palace swordsmen, his Black Dragon Coat fluttering down to his knees. With each step Raon took, the Light Wind Palace swordsmen followed, their hands on their sword hilts.<br><br>Raon and the Light Wind Palace swordsmen set out on the road to Balkar, emanating a noble aura as if they had become a master craftsman's noted sword.</p>
