        <p>"You... are... a good... human...But..."<br><br>Sloth's dark eyes twisted at a grotesque angle as they turned toward Raon.<br><br>"I... cannot... forgive... constantly... disturbing... my... sleep..."<br><br>Black currents of energy erupted from beneath his feet, spreading in all directions. With a violent surge, the blanket and pillow Raon had given him earlier were torn apart as if they had never existed, and an eerily black storm poured down above them.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Raon bit his lip as he felt the intense Authority emanating from Sloth.<br><br>'Even though he knows I'm Wrath's vessel, he still takes this attitude?'<br><br>This was getting rather dangerous. Despite knowing Raon could summon Wrath right now, Sloth was releasing a terrible aura as if he intended to kill him. He seemed angry enough not to care about the consequences.<br><br>-That fellow is about to explode.<br><br>Wrath frowned as he observed Sloth's behavior.<br><br>'Hasn't he already exploded?'<br><br>Raon let out a breath as he felt Sloth's aura growing stronger.<br><br>-If Sloth had truly exploded, your head would have disappeared long ago.<br><br>Wrath clicked his tongue, noting that Sloth was barely maintaining his rationality.<br><br>'Why is he so angry?'<br><br>Raon furrowed his brows as he examined the place where Sloth had been sleeping.<br><br>'Though I didn't do it, he's not the type to get this angry over being woken up once.'<br><br>Sloth had been awakened several times before due to the war between Eden and Habun Castle. But except for the last time, he hadn't come down from Mount Sturin, so Raon couldn't understand why he was so angry now.<br><br>-I don't know either.<br><br>Wrath nodded in agreement.<br><br>-As I've said before, that sleepyhead is one of the gentler Demon Kings. It's strange for him to get angry so quickly...<br><br>'Wait.'<br><br>Raon lowered his eyebrows as he watched Sloth grow larger like a shadow at sunset.<br><br>'Didn’t you say earlier that Sloth had been repeatedly awakened from his sleep?'<br><br>-Ah! Then...<br><br>'Yes. That shock we felt wasn't the first time it happened.'<br><br>It was clear now why Sloth was so angry - that powerful shockwave they'd felt before climbing Mount Sturin had occurred repeatedly, disturbing his sleep.<br><br>"Why... do you... disturb... my sleep... All I want... is to be left... alone..."<br><br>Sloth released an enormous Authority of Sloth that could erase Mount Sturin and more, as if his patience had reached its limit. The rumbling pressure of Sloth's aura alone made one's knees buckle and back bend.<br><br>-Such rotten luck. Like getting hit by bird droppings while walking by.<br><br>Wrath nodded as if he now understood.<br><br>-Wonder which bastard did this...<br><br>'Unfortunately, now's not the time to think about that.'<br><br>Raon shook his head as he operated Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation and Glacier. He couldn't afford to think about anything else - one wrong glance could cost him his life.<br><br>-Unlike usual, your brain isn't working today.<br><br>Wrath snorted in derision.<br><br>-You could just release my Authority and put on that crazy act like before, it would work.<br><br>He shook his head, indicating that Sloth hadn't completely lost his reason yet.<br><br>-Your brain must be frozen…<br><br>'No.'<br><br>Raon calmly shook his head, smiling as he endured Sloth's Authority.<br><br>'A chance to test my abilities has presented itself - I can't just let it pass.'<br><br>As Wrath suggested, if he released Wrath's power and acted like a Demon King, he could calm Sloth who hadn't completely lost his reason yet. However, doing so would mean losing the only chance to evaluate his martial prowess after a month of growth.<br><br>-You crazy fool!<br><br>Wrath widened his eyes in disbelief.<br><br>-It's still too much for you!<br><br>He firmly shook his head, indicating that defeating Sloth would be impossible.<br><br>'I know that.'<br><br>-You could really die!<br><br>'Even if it's a bit dangerous...'<br><br>Raon drew the Heavenly Drive and Wooden Ring Sword, plunging them into the lake where the Authority of Sloth writhed. The earth-shaking sloth dissipated as red and blue flashes rose up. A golden sun and silver moon rose in the dark night sky, pushing back the darkness summoned by the Demon King.<br><br>"If you think I'm the same as before..."<br><br>Raon raised his Divine Sword and Demonic Sword, burning with solemn flames and cold frost, pointing them at Sloth.<br><br>"You'll never sleep again."<br><br>***<br><br>"Welcome back."<br><br>Burren bowed to Karoon who had returned to the Central Martial Palace.<br><br>"Mm."<br><br>Karoon narrowed his eyes as he noticed the sweat on Burren's forehead.<br><br>"Have you been training until now?"<br><br>He shook his chin as if asking why Burren had trained so late.<br><br>"I had matters to attend to during the day, so I worked out late."<br><br>Burren bowed his head, explaining he had no choice due to being busy.<br><br>"Did your business go well?"<br><br>"Not bad."<br><br>Karoon raised his right hand. In his grip was a Golden Tablet that seemed to have been recently received.<br><br>"A, a Golden Tablet already?"<br><br>Burren's jaw trembled as he looked at the Golden Tablet gleaming in the moonlight.<br><br>"I caught a wanted criminal. A murderer who disgustingly gathered people around him and played at being king."<br><br>Karoon roughly dusted his hands in disgust.<br><br>"A-a wanted criminal? Just who did you catch to receive a Golden Tablet..."<br><br>Burren swallowed dryly as he asked for the criminal's name.<br><br>"The Northern Sea Demon."<br><br>"T-the Northern Sea Demon disappeared decades ago! How did you catch someone like that!"<br><br>The Northern Sea Demon was an evil spirit who had fled after killing countless people in Zieghart's territory. Even then, he possessed Grandmaster-level martial prowess, and was cold-hearted enough to use his own children and subordinates as bait. He was thought to be impossible to find now, so Burren couldn't understand how he had been caught.<br><br>"We found traces of the Northern Sea Demon while searching for the Five Demons before the war with the White Blood Religion. The Central Martial Palace's informants worked hard."<br><br>Karoon nodded, indicating it wasn't just his effort but the result of the entire Central Martial Palace working diligently. <br><br>"He was a top-tier Grandmaster decades ago with exceptional mental cultivation, so I had expectations, but his muscles had grown too fat and there was no thrill in fighting him."<br><br>He clicked his tongue briefly, disappointed in the Northern Sea Demon's abilities.<br><br>"W-well, that's amazing..."<br><br>Burren let out a hollow laugh. Though he knew Karoon would move quickly, he never imagined he would return with a Golden Tablet in just a few days.<br><br>"It's nothing special."<br><br>Karoon shook his head heavily.<br><br>"This is just the beginning."<br><br>He calmly clenched his fist, suggesting he would achieve even more in the future.<br><br>"What will you do?"<br><br>Karoon narrowed his eyes, curious about Burren's resolve.<br><br>"I..."<br><br>Burren bit his lip as he met Karoon's gaze.<br><br>"I want to challenge for the position of head of house. I know it's nearly impossible, but still..."<br><br>"That's a good idea."<br><br>Rather than dismissing Burren's intention, Karoon nodded in approval.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>Burren's eyes widened in disbelief.<br><br>"I-I thought you'd say it was pointless..."<br><br>"As you said, the chances are nearly zero. No, it's probably impossible."<br><br>Karoon smiled faintly as he looked into Burren's eyes.<br><br>"However, if you challenge yourself, you'll certainly gain something."<br><br>He patted Burren's shoulder as if encouraging him to try his best.<br><br>"Th-thank you..."<br><br>Burren stood dazed for a moment before bowing his head.<br><br>'To think he'd say the same thing as Raon.'<br><br>He never expected Karoon would encourage his succession challenge with the same words as Raon. His mouth remained open in surprise.<br><br>"Hmm."<br><br>Karoon stopped as he was about to enter the mansion.<br><br>"I heard Raon left the family regardless of his duties, is that true?"<br><br>He slowly turned his gaze as if he knew about Raon's whereabouts.<br><br>"Ah, yes. But he's not taking the succession test lightly. In his own way, Raon..."<br><br>"I know. Even now, probably..."<br><br>Karoon looked up at the dark night sky with a gentle smile.<br><br>"He must be doing something special for both the family and himself."<br><br>He smiled as if he understood all of Raon's intentions.<br><br>"Though I have no intention of losing."<br><br>Karoon entered the mansion with a slight smile. Strangely, his steps seemed even more energetic after returning from his mission.<br><br>'Father too...'<br><br>Burren's fingers trembled as he watched Karoon's back, which seemed even broader than Raon's.<br><br>'Is he entering a different realm?'<br><br>***<br><br>Flames, frost, and darkness churned, twisting the high, deep night sky of the Northern Sea. Raon swung his Divine Sword and Demonic Sword to deflect the fierce black currents of energy. The strain was so great that tendons stood out on his jaw and cheeks.<br><br>Sloth spread the black currents wide like tree roots, as if determined not to let Raon escape.<br><br>"Where do you think you're going."<br><br>Raon raised his Divine Sword and Demonic Sword, wrapped in red and blue radiance, cutting through the wave-like black currents in a figure-eight pattern. However, Sloth's energy was so tough and thick that even the Divine and Demonic Swords couldn't cut through it completely.<br><br>'Feels like my shoulders might give out.'<br><br>Even with his Sword Domain released and using Fangs of Insanity and Blizzard Sword Art at full power, he was being pushed back. He wasn't yet at the level to face Demon Kings head-on.<br><br>'Moreover...'<br><br>The longer he fought, the more his strength drained from his entire body. The black currents Sloth was spreading weren't aura, but the Authority of Sloth. Even though he hadn't been hit directly and was defending with his swords, his will to fight was breaking, and thoughts of dying to rest invaded his mind. This was the moment he truly felt the terrifying power of a Demon King's Authority.<br><br>-That's the terror of the Authority wielded by Demon Kings.<br><br>Wrath wrinkled his nose.<br><br>-If someone with weak willpower faces that Authority, they'll willingly sink into the rest of death.<br><br>He shook his head, warning not to be exposed to the Sloth.<br><br>'Even though I have the Authority of Sloth within my soul?'<br><br>-Because he's the master of all that Sloth.<br><br>Wrath jerked his chin, explaining that because the power was received from Sloth, it would have an even greater effect.<br><br>'It's certainly dangerous power, but it doesn't matter.'<br><br>Raon smiled as he tightened his grip on the swords.<br><br>'Because I have the Ring of Fire that overcame the Monarch of Wrath.'<br><br>When he resonated with the Ring of Fire, Sloth's Authority that had been weighing down his soul grew hazy like fog in sunlight.<br><br>-Urgh!<br><br>Wrath stared at Raon, his mouth hanging open in shock.<br><br>-That cheating martial art! No, I'm not even sure it can be called a martial art anymore!<br><br>He ground his teeth, amazed at the increasingly inconceivable power.<br><br>'Now I can fight properly.'<br><br>Raon stepped back once, then used the momentum to charge forward even faster. Sloth shot out an enormous Authority of Sloth like a flash of light, as if intending not to put him to sleep but to erase him completely.<br><br>Raon executed the Flame Dragon Strike with his Divine Sword. From the mouth of the Fire Dragon descending on the sword's edge poured flames that could burn even hellfire.<br><br>However, Sloth's Authority wasn't erased by the Flame Dragon Strike's flames, instead pushing forward with even greater force. Dark red sparks exploded in all directions from the collision of such mighty powers.<br><br>"Then try this..."<br><br>Raon twisted his lips slightly as he raised his Demonic Sword at an angle.<br><br>"Take this."<br><br>A massive sphere rose from the silver-burning Demonic Sword. The Heavy Sky Cannon - Raon Zieghart's unique swordsmanship that rivaled the Flame Dragon Strike in power. The Heavy Sky Cannon absorbed the Authority of Sloth with its mighty gravitational force before exploding, freezing everything around it.<br><br>Mount Sturin, which hadn't thawed for ten thousand years, froze even whiter.<br><br>"Give... back... my... sleep..."<br><br>Sloth instantly shattered the frost freezing his forearms and shoulders, and scattered an even more densely concentrated Authority of Sloth. Raon raised two pairs of Fire Walls to block the fiercely incoming Authority of Sloth, but couldn't withstand it and was pushed back.<br><br>Raon was finally forced out of the lake where Sloth had been staying and crashed against a rock wall.<br><br>Sloth extended his black arm as if refusing to let him escape. His hand was long and massive enough to reach the end of the world.<br><br>'It'll be dangerous if that hand catches me.'<br><br>He felt an ominous premonition that if caught in that grip, he wouldn't be able to escape the Sloth even while using the Ring of Fire.<br><br>'I'll cut it.'<br><br>Raon clenched his molars and straightened his knees. The Divine Sword pointed to the sky while the Demonic Sword sank toward the earth. The two swords curved in opposite directions, releasing a magnificent aura. Sky-Piercing Thunder - Glenn's swordsmanship that harmonized the Azure Sky Sword and Celestial Thunder Arts techniques called forth red skies and blue lightning through Raon's Sword Domain.<br><br>The lightning of destruction fell like divine wrath, striking down on the back of Sloth's hand.<br><br>"You're strong... Wrath's vessel..."<br><br>Though Sloth took a direct hit from the Sky-Piercing Thunder and received great damage, he summoned an even stronger Authority of Sloth to try to devour Raon.<br><br>'Damn.'<br><br>Raon furrowed his brow as he watched Sloth's Authority surge in at that instant.<br><br>'I can't block this.'<br><br>Having just used Sky-Piercing Thunder, his aura control wasn't smooth. Dodging was the only answer now. Raon consumed a large amount of his Divine Sword's flames and Demonic Sword's frost to get as far away from Sloth as possible.<br><br>But the Authority of Sloth that Sloth released seemed unsatisfied with just consuming the flames and frost, pursuing Raon like lightning.<br><br>'This power really suits him.'<br><br>Seeing how his body remained still while only his hands and the Authority of Sloth moved, Raon thought it was a perfectly fitting ability for Sloth.<br><br>-Give up now.<br><br>Wrath shook his head as if telling him to stop.<br><br>-Fighting that sleepyhead head-on with your current martial prowess is impossible.<br><br>He lowered his eyebrows as if telling him to stop trying to confront him directly.<br><br>'I clearly understand too. That my power is insufficient.'<br><br>-If you've realized that, then just give up and...<br><br>'If my current power isn't enough...'<br><br>Raon executed the Supreme Harmony Step and charged straight at Sloth. Showing his white teeth, he simultaneously released his newly accumulated Willpower and the Demon Kings' Authority.<br><br>'I'll just use even greater power!'<br><br>-Y-you crazy fool!<br><br>'I haven't gone all out yet.'<br><br>He hadn't used all the techniques he learned from Glenn and Darkan. He could become even stronger than he was now.<br><br>"Demon King of Sloth."<br><br>Raon curved his lips upward as he faced the increasingly powerful Sloth.<br><br>"Test my true self."</p>
