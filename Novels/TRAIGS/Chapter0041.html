        <p>“What do you mean by the real deal?”<br><br>The third prince swallowed and took a step back. Because he was unaware of the identity and intention of the elf that had suddenly appeared, he started by keeping a distance.<br><br>“You don’t need to be so afraid.”<br><br>“I’m not afraid.”<br><br>He frowned, looking up to the red-haired elf.<br><br>“Answer my question first. What is the real deal?”<br><br>“That’s…”<br><br>“Wait.”<br><br>When the elf was about to answer, Duke Tartan burst from the ground. It almost looked like he came out from the shadow created by the hall’s lighting.<br><br>“Zieghart’s Sword of Light, why are you here?”<br><br>“Eek!”<br><br>Greer’s eyes widened upon hearing the title mentioned by Duke Tartan.<br><br>‘Zieghart’s Sword of Light!’<br><br>He finally realized who the elf was. He was one of the Glenn Zieghart’s devoted retainers, whose sword is rumored to be as fast as the light.<br><br>‘But why did he come to me…?’<br><br>He’d heard about his retirement after an injury, but he didn’t understand why he came looking for him.<br><br>“Ah, there’s no need to be so tense.”<br><br>Rimmer shook his hand, expressing that he had no intention to fight.<br><br>“I’ve seen you acting like a madman over and over again. Of course, I can’t relax around you.”<br><br>“As you see, I’ve changed a lot.”<br><br>“Hmm…”<br><br>Without withdrawing his pressure, Duke Tartan took a glance behind him.<br><br>“Your highness, what did this crazy elf talk about?”<br><br>“He asked whether I wanted to meet the real deal.”<br><br>“The real deal? What do you mean?”<br><br>“Hmm, it’d be a bit awkward to say it here now.”<br><br>Extending his arm, Rimmer pointed to the surroundings. The banquet had become silent, and everyone was watching them.<br><br>“Well, I’m actually uninvited.”<br><br>Laughing off the gazes pouring down from everywhere, he turned around.<br><br>“The prince of Owen.”<br><br>Rimmer stopped, then turned around while he was walking towards the exit.<br><br>“If you want to see the real deal, tell them you want to visit the fifth training ground when you are observing the training tomorrow.”<br><br>After saying that, he left the banquet hall.<br><br>Once Rimmer—who even said that he came uninvited—had left, the music started playing once again.<br><br>However, Rimmer's last words were the only thing that resounded inside Greer’s head.<br><br>‘The real deal exists in the fifth training ground, huh?’<br><br> <br><br>***<br><br> <br><br>“Huhuhu!”<br><br>“Hmph.”<br><br>Raon frowned, hearing Rimmer’s humming.<br><br>‘Why is he doing that?’<br><br>Rimmer, who should have been lying down napping after telling the other instructors to teach, was personally giving directions with his eyes clearly open. It was making Raon feel anxious for some reason.<br><br>“What is wrong with that man?”<br><br>“That’s what I’m saying.”<br><br>“Maybe it was something he ate?”<br><br>“He probably won some money at the gambling house yesterday.”<br><br>Burren and the other trainees also kept glancing at Rimmer while swinging their swords.<br><br>“Head instructor, did something good happen?”<br><br>Dorian, who was curious despite being a coward, approached Rimmer.<br><br>“There will be guests.”<br><br>‘Guests?’<br><br>It was even more confusing now, because Rimmer hated annoying things. And yet, he was looking forward to the guests.<br><br>‘I should just keep training.’<br><br>The elf was just so strange that it was impossible to guess his actions or thoughts. It was better to just focus on training.<br><br>Raon drew on the burning aura from his energy center and extended his right foot.<br><br> <br><br>Stomp!<br><br> <br><br>Starting with a groundbreaking sound of a stride, he performed the River Footwork and Combination Sword at once.<br><br>Between the footwork that flowed as naturally as water, a sharp, light sword burst up.<br><br> <br><br>Slash!<br><br> <br><br>Despite being a mixture between defensive footwork and offensive swordsmanship, it didn’t feel unnatural at all. That was because both techniques focused on flow and combination.<br><br>The flow was natural, as if he was using a single martial art to begin with.<br><br>Feeling the other trainees’ gazes, which he had gotten used to, he performed the swordsmanship and the footwork until the end.<br><br>“Huff.”<br><br>Raon let his sword down, exhaling as he finished performing the swordsmanship and footwork at once.<br><br>‘It’s still not enough.’<br><br>There were a few improper parts because he’d combined the use of his swordsmanship, footwork, and aura.<br><br>He needed more practice before it became usable in a real battle.<br><br>“Again.”<br><br>As he was about to practice once again, he felt multiple presences from the training ground main entrance.<br><br>“Hmm?”<br><br>“What is that?”<br><br>The instructors reacted after Raon, then the trainees also stopped swinging their swords.<br><br>When everyone’s gaze was directed at the entrance, a knocking sound could be heard.<br><br>“Go ahead.”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>While smiling, Rimmer gestured to an instructor. The instructor, who was standing at the center, started to open the door to the training ground.<br><br>“I’m Gesman from the general administration.”<br><br>A neat young man wearing a uniform stuck his head out, and the knights wearing silver armor were waiting behind him.<br><br>“The people from the Owen Kingdom’s envoy wanted to observe the fifth training ground’s training. It might be sudden, but is it possible to attend?”<br><br>“Please enter, guests are always welcome.”<br><br>Rimmer came to the door in the blink of an eye and opened it wide.<br><br>“Th-thank you. Please enter.”<br><br>Gesman bowed. Wiping the sweat from his forehead, he guided the Owen Kingdom’s envoy inside the training ground.<br><br>“Huh.”<br><br>Raon smirked, sheathing his training sword at his waist.<br><br>‘Guests are welcome?’<br><br>Rimmer refused to show the information on their training, even to the swordsmen of the same household. Him saying that the guests were welcome was the biggest bullshit ever.<br><br>When he looked around, other trainees were also rolling their eyes in surprise.<br><br>“The Owen Kingdom’s envoys used their precious time to visit us. Show them what kind of martial art the Zieghart’s trainees have learned.”<br><br>Rimmer, who used to be at the door, suddenly appeared on the platform. He wasn’t even moving like the wind at that point, and he was like a ghost instead.<br><br>“What does he want, all of the sudden?”<br><br>“Hmm…”<br><br>“Well, we should just act like always.”<br><br>Receiving the gazes of the Owen Kingdom's envoys, the trainees started creaking like a broken doll.<br><br>“Get a grip! You should calm down even more at a time like this and do your best!”<br><br> <br><br>* * *<br><br> <br><br>Burren was no different than usual. Or rather, he was moving even better, and led the trainees.<br><br>‘It worked.’<br><br>As expected of someone who gave himself to Zieghart, he knew what he was supposed to show.<br><br>“I don’t want to be a clown.”<br><br>Martha snorted and crossed her arms. Emitting a pressure as fierce as facing an enemy, she glared at the Owen Kingdom’s envoys. She looked ready to fight them if they wanted.<br><br>‘She hasn’t changed.’<br><br>Martha had only become softer to him, and she was still as fierce and bad-mouthed as ever.<br><br>Runaan wasn’t interested in them at all. She kept swinging her sword using her footwork, without a single moment’s interruption.<br><br>‘I think she might be the strongest.’<br><br>Not losing focus in that kind of messy situation was a peerless talent.<br><br>Raon skimmed through the Owen Kingdom’s envoys one after another. The blue-eyed knight trainee was carefully watching Burren, Martha and Runaan, one after another.<br><br>He seemed rather surprised, with his mouth slightly open.<br><br>‘And he still didn’t recognize me.’<br><br>Despite noticing those three, he seemed unaware of Raon’s might.<br><br>‘Well.’<br><br>Raon smiled slightly and pulled out his training sword, his legs at shoulder’s width.<br><br>‘Shall I start as well?’<br><br>The River Footwork and Combination sword were both extremely simple in their forms and postures.<br><br>It was a testament to their strength that they wouldn’t get weaker once seen, so there was no problem with having observers.<br><br> <br><br>Swoosh!<br><br> <br><br>Without minding the gazes, Raon naturally blended in the flow of the sword and footwork.<br><br> <br><br>***<br><br> <br><br>The third prince Greer De Owen had visited two places before coming to the fifth training ground.<br><br>The first was the second training ground, where those who’d already received the title of swordsman were practicing.<br><br>‘It was amazing.’<br><br>The swordsmen from the second training ground were powerful, befitting the great name of Zieghart.<br><br>They weren’t inferior in any way compared to the Owen Kingdom’s knights in swordsmanship, pressure, body, and mind.<br><br>‘However, the sixth training ground where the trainees practiced was rather disappointing.’<br><br>The trainees at the six training grounds were talented, but they lacked practice.<br><br>He’d originally planned to request a spar, but he gave up since the result was too obvious.<br><br>‘That’s when I remembered.’<br><br>When he was going to head back, he remembered what Rimmer had mentioned. That question about whether he wanted to see the real deal.<br><br>That was why he told the officer from the general administration, who was about to guide them elsewhere, that he wanted to see the fifth training ground.<br><br>He seemed flustered, but he guided them to the fifth training ground without refusing the request.<br><br>He actually didn’t have high expectations.<br><br>He thought the fifth training ground wouldn’t be much different from the sixth training ground.<br><br>However, that was a huge mistake.<br><br>He understood the moment he entered the training ground that it was different.<br><br>The talent and the amount of training they did was on a whole different dimension from the sixth training ground.<br><br>‘The real deal was this place.’<br><br>Rimmer was correct. The trainees from the fifth training ground weren’t any weaker than the knight trainees.<br><br>The blue-haired boy and the silver-haired girl especially were one level stronger than the others.<br><br>And the black-haired beauty who was glaring at them also possessed an overwhelming pressure.<br><br>All three of them were as strong as himself, or Setun, who was called the strongest knight trainee.<br><br>“This was the real one indeed.”<br><br>Duke Tartan furrowed his brows while watching the trainees.<br><br>“It looks like it.”<br><br>“Although it looks like there’s not a big difference in talent except for a few. The difference is mostly with how much they’ve trained.”<br><br>“Hmm…”<br><br>Greer nodded. The fifth training ground had a completely different atmosphere. He could smell the passion filled with the trainees’ blood and sweat.<br><br>“Those three are particularly amazing.”<br><br>The knight trainee Setun’s eyes shone with the intention to fight. He was also watching the three powerhouses he’d recognized.<br><br>“I want to try fighting them.”<br><br>“Same goes for me.”<br><br>The third prince and Setun licked their lips, watching the three people they thought were the strongest in the fifth training ground.<br><br>“How is it? Just like I’ve said, the real ones are here, right?”<br><br>A voice as cool as the wind could be heard from behind.<br><br>“Hmm?”<br><br>When they turned around, Rimmer was standing there with the same smile as the day before.<br><br>“Certainly, I understand why you said that before.”<br><br>Greer nodded.<br><br>“You seem to be itching for a fight. How about sparring with one of our boys?”<br><br>“Was that the goal?”<br><br>“It’s a rare opportunity to fight against one of the Six King’s talents in complete safety. It will also help you.”<br><br>Rimmer pointed towards the trainees who were focused on their swords.<br><br>“Hmm…”<br><br>Greer turned around to look at Duke Tartan. Since he was the actual leader, he needed his permission.<br><br>“That sounds fine.”<br><br>Duke Tartan nodded but gave Rimmer a cold gaze. His face seemed to say that he would cut him down the moment he tried something funny.<br><br>“I just want some sparring. However.”<br><br>Rimmer raised both his hands and smiled.<br><br>“Are you fine with a small bet?”<br><br>“Bet?”<br><br>“Yes. After twenty duels, the loser rewards the winner.”<br><br>“Hah, do you think you can win against us?”<br><br>“Oh, you are pretty confident, huh?”<br><br>“Of course. Because they are the elites among the Owen’s knight trainees!”<br><br>Duke Tartan was full of confidence as he looked at the knight trainees.<br><br>“I’m glad.”<br><br>Rimmer smiled. His eyes were clearly shining in dark green.<br><br>“Since I also trust my boys.”</p>
