        <p>"My answer is always the same."<br><br>Raon extended his right hand not toward Darkan who had asked the question, but toward Glenn.<br><br>"An unbreakable sword that bows to no one, a strong sword that remains unwavering through any storm. That's the sword I desire."<br><br>He recalled the vow he had declared to Vulcan at the charcoal kiln and had kept until now.<br><br>"A sword that bows to no one..."<br><br>Glenn drew a subtle smile, as if pleased with his answer.<br><br>"Not bad?"<br><br>Darkan grinned while drawing a semicircle with his hand.<br><br>"If you keep stabbing with an unbreakable sword, you could eventually cut through Derus's soul no matter how vast it is."<br><br>He laughed, suggesting that his Soul Sword might be the answer.<br><br>"However, there's one problem."<br><br>Darkan raised his index finger.<br><br>"No matter how thick and sturdy your Soul Sword is, if the blade is dull, you won't be able to cut his soul."<br><br>He looked at Glenn as if asking for his opinion.<br><br>"You're not wrong. The Soul Sword must be sharper than a physical blade."<br><br>Glenn nodded, saying one must hone the soul blade like a master forging a noted sword.<br><br>"Of course, I deliberately made mine dull!"<br><br>Darkan shrugged, explaining that he hadn't sharpened his Soul Sword's edge because he wanted to summon the enemy's soul into his Mental Image.<br><br>"Anyway, we've reached an understanding."<br><br>Darkan smiled brightly as he extended his hand to Glenn.<br><br>"Looks like you and I will have lots to do over the next month?"<br><br>"Indeed."<br><br>Despite his words of agreement, Glenn didn't take Darkan's hand, instead closing and opening his eyes.<br><br>"Since minds are clearest in the morning, you develop his Willpower, and I'll enhance his techniques in the afternoon."<br><br>Darkan wiggled his finger, suggesting they split their time teaching Raon.<br><br>"And finally, in the evening, let's discuss Soul Sword among the three of us."<br><br>"You, why are you so serious?"<br><br>Glenn furrowed his brows as he looked at Darkan.<br><br>“Because this moment is the sword itself.”<br><br>Darkan maintained a solemn posture as he expressed that life itself was the sword.<br><br>"...I understand."<br><br>Glenn seemed to sense Darkan's sincerity and accepted his opinion.<br><br>"Then I'll just watch."<br><br>Despite saying he would watch, Darkan remained standing where he was without backing away. He was indeed an extraordinary person.<br><br>"Raon."<br><br>Glenn called out to Raon, ignoring Darkan.<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>Raon approached Glenn and bowed his head.<br><br>"Come to think of it, something puzzles me."<br><br>Glenn narrowed his eyes.<br><br>"Your Willpower has always been at a higher level than your swordsmanship, and your realm of the soul has risen even further, so why has the Willpower in your sword weakened?"<br><br>He frowned, showing his confusion.<br><br>"I'm not sure either."<br><br>Raon licked his lips while lowering his gaze.<br><br>'Grandfather is right.'<br><br>He hadn't neglected his Mental Image training, so he was also surprised to hear that his Willpower was lacking.<br><br>-Sure, that old Nadine bread geezer might not know, but...<br><br>Wrath perched on his shoulder.<br><br>-Shouldn't you know?<br><br>He frowned as if wondering why Raon couldn't realize it.<br><br>'What?'<br><br>Raon's eyes widened as he looked at Wrath.<br><br>'What do you mean?'<br><br>-Your Willpower is strong, but it is weakened.<br><br>Wrath shook his head, telling him to understand this properly.<br><br>'It is weakened?'<br><br>-What do you think Willpower is?<br><br>'It's the power that manifests through the soul when wishing for my imagination to become reality.'<br><br>Willpower was pouring that intense desire to transform mental imagery into reality into the sword.<br><br>-That's roughly correct. However, you...<br><br>Wrath narrowed his eyes as he looked at him.<br><br>-You've mixed something else into that Willpower.<br><br>'Something else?'<br><br>-The Authority of myself and other demon kings.<br><br>His eyes flashed with a cold blue light.<br><br>-Those Authorities were a great help during life-or-death battles, but consequently, your Willpower has weakened proportionally.<br><br>'Ah, so that's why...'<br><br>-Since the demon kings' Authority fulfilled your wishes instead, it's natural that your Willpower weakened.<br><br>Wrath snorted as if mocking his inability to properly handle his own power.<br><br>'Now I understand.'<br><br>He now understood why Glenn felt his Willpower was weak and why he hadn't noticed its weakening himself.<br><br>'Authority wasn't an omnipotent power.'<br><br>He had thought it only gave benefits, but now he realized it was a dangerous power that could harm him as well.<br><br>'Then the method to restore it should be simple.'<br><br>Raon thought about how to recover his Willpower and nodded.<br><br>"Raon?"<br><br>Glenn called out to the contemplative Raon.<br><br>"Are you alright?"<br><br>"I apologize. I was organizing my thoughts."<br><br>Raon bowed his head to Glenn.<br><br>"Organizing your thoughts?"<br><br>"Grandfather is correct. My Willpower seems to have weakened because I focused on other powers. So..."<br><br>He placed his right hand on the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>"I would like grandfather to attack me with swordsmanship imbued with Willpower."<br><br>"Can you endure it?"<br><br>Glenn narrowed his eyes as if doubting Raon could handle it now.<br><br>"I can do it. No, even if I can't, I must."<br><br>Raon nodded and drew the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>"Very well."<br><br>Glenn raised the Heavenly Tremor as if reading the determination in Raon's eyes.<br><br>"However, it won't be easy to block."<br><br>He swung down the Heavenly Tremor with fierce eyes, showing his seriousness. The sword unleashed a destructive energy wave that seemed capable of collapsing the sky, despite not containing strong aura.<br><br>"Excellent!"<br><br>Darkan clapped as soon as Glenn displayed his swordsmanship, acting like his fan. With a resounding clash, Raon blocked Glenn's falling Heavenly Tremor by raising his Heavenly Drive diagonally.<br><br>'Willpower...'<br><br>He strengthened his grip on the Heavenly Drive, determined to not only block Glenn's sword but to push it back.<br><br>-Not bad.<br><br>Wrath nodded, acknowledging the improvement from before.<br><br>"Not bad at all."<br><br>Glenn smiled faintly, as if pleased with the start.<br><br>"Though it will weaken again, please don't reduce the intensity."<br><br>After making his request, Raon summoned the demon kings' Authority buried deep in his soul. With a crackling sound, six Authorities manifested above the Heavenly Drive, beginning to forcefully push back Glenn's sword.<br><br>-You, what are you doing!<br><br>Wrath's eyes bulged as he demanded to know why Raon was doing something so crazy.<br><br>-I told you relying on Authority weakens your Willpower!<br><br>He tapped his forehead, telling Raon to come to his senses.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Glenn furrowed his brows as if noticing that Raon was using powers other than Willpower.<br><br>"Please don't stop, continue."<br><br>Raon separated the demon kings' Authority that was trying to seep into his Willpower, saying they mustn't stop. Instead of combining Willpower and Authority to swing his sword as before, he made the two forces fight against each other. A rumbling sound echoed.<br><br>When he made Willpower and Authority clash, the power in his sword weakened compared to when he used Willpower alone.<br><br>With a crackling sound, the Heavenly Drive was pushed back by Glenn's Heavenly Tremor, causing his knees to nearly touch the ground.<br><br>"Are you really alright?"<br><br>Glenn looked at him with concerned eyes.<br><br>"Please continue!"<br><br>Raon nodded despite his waist bending.<br><br>-You. What in the world are you trying to do...<br><br>Wrath blinked in disbelief.<br><br>-Aren't both Willpower and Authority being destroyed as they compete!<br><br>He slapped Raon's back, telling him to come to his senses.<br><br>'This is the answer.'<br><br>Raon bit his lip and shook his head.<br><br>'Just as muscles tear and regenerate stronger, energy grows stronger through conflict.'<br><br>The flames of the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation and Glacier's frost were opposing properties, so they fought endlessly and grew stronger through that conflict. Similarly, if he made Willpower and Authority fight each other, both forces would likely grow faster as they struggled to overcome each other.<br><br>'Moreover...'<br><br>Raon ground his molars as he watched Glenn swing his sword heavy with Willpower.<br><br>'With the strongest opponent here, I can't help but grow stronger.'<br><br>Though his mind felt like it would break from maintaining the battle between Willpower and Authority while blocking Glenn's sword, such difficulties would ultimately lead to his growth. Just as they always had. While somehow managing to block Glenn's sword without falling, despite nearly collapsing...<br><br>He felt his soul growing thicker.<br><br>[Willpower is growing.]<br><br>[The Monarchs' Authority is strengthening.]<br><br>[Realm of the soul has risen.]<br><br>Along with the messages appearing before his eyes, he could feel his sword gaining a slight boost in power. With a ringing sound, Glenn's sword, which had been pressing forward like a tide, was pushed back a span for the first time.<br><br>'The hard work paid off.'<br><br>In half a day, he achieved what he couldn't have gained even after ten days of solo training. Indeed, training with Glenn was worth more than a thousand gold pieces.<br><br>"Very good."<br><br>Glenn also let out a small exclamation, seeming to notice his change.<br><br>"Already improved? What is this really?"<br><br>Darkan let out a hollow laugh, amazed at the rapid growth.<br><br>-Ugh...<br><br>Wrath also bulged his eyes, as if he hadn't expected the messages to appear so quickly.<br><br>'See that?'<br><br>Raon laughed as he elbowed Wrath.<br><br>'Kids grow through fighting. However...'<br><br>He bit his lip deeply as he raised his blurring eyes.<br><br>'This is really tough.'<br><br>Trying to control the battling Willpower and Authority while blocking Glenn's sword was hellish. Though he had only trained for half a day, it felt like he had been swinging his sword for ten days without sleep.<br><br>'Even so...'<br><br>Raon licked his lips as he raised the Heavenly Drive again.<br><br>'I must continue.'<br><br>To see the end of this path.<br><br>"Again."<br><br>Raon took his stance again and stood before Glenn.<br><br>"Please, once more!"<br><br>***<br><br>After finishing lunch, Raon faced Darkan at the training ground.<br><br>"Now it's my turn."<br><br>Darkan smiled brightly, saying he had been waiting.<br><br>"What's lacking in my sword?"<br><br>Raon brought his hands together in front, saying he would listen carefully.<br><br>"Harmony."<br><br>Darkan waved his hand lightly. A strange sense of stability emanated from the aura that rose above his palm.<br><br>"Harmony?"<br><br>"It's true that your sword is heading toward perfection. I understand why Glenn tries not to interfere with your swordsmanship. However, I'm different."<br><br>He raised his finger to point at his eye patch.<br><br>"After losing my eye and having to rely on my other senses, I became extremely sensitive to others' movements."<br><br>Darkan continued speaking as he wiped the smile from his face.<br><br>"Even without using aura, I can feel the fine hairs on the back of my hand moving in the wind."<br><br>He tapped the back of his hand, saying that alone was enough to tell him the wind's strength and direction, even predicting the weather.<br><br>"Since all my senses except sight have surpassed human limits, my perception of swordsmanship has also changed."<br><br>"I suppose so..."<br><br>Raon nodded.<br><br>"Those senses detected a slight tremor in your sword."<br><br>Darkan nodded, saying that because he lacked an eye, he could feel the distortion in Raon's swordsmanship.<br><br>"If you tune that distortion like piano strings, your sword will reach a new level."<br><br>He extended his hand, asking if Raon wanted to take on the challenge.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Glenn stood with his arms crossed, saying nothing, as if agreeing with Darkan's words.<br><br>"What should I do?"<br><br>Raon took Darkan's hand without hesitation.<br><br>"Show me your swordsmanship again before me."<br><br>Darkan nodded, telling him to perform the swordsmanship he had shown at dawn.<br><br>"Understood."<br><br>Raon steadied his breath and displayed the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation swordsmanship in sequence. After performing Revolving Sky, Crimson Slash, and Fire Spirit in succession, Darkan reached out his hand just as Raon was about to unleash the Flame Dragon Strike.<br><br>"Stop. Do that swordsmanship again."<br><br>He waved his hand, telling him to perform Fire Spirit again.<br><br>"Alright."<br><br>Raon nodded and ignited a tree of flames along his blade.<br><br>"Again."<br><br>Darkan shook his head, still unsatisfied, telling him to do it again. With a swoosh, Raon continued to perform Fire Spirit, and Darkan endlessly called for repetition. As this continued, countless traces of flame fragments marked the training ground floor like fallen petals.<br><br>"Again."<br><br>"Understood."<br><br>Raon performed Fire Spirit dozens of times without a single complaint.<br><br>"Why aren't you asking why we keep repeating?"<br><br>Darkan rubbed his chin, seemingly intrigued.<br><br>"You said my sword lacks harmony. Since that hasn't been fixed, we keep repeating."<br><br>"You're not even asking me to explain it?"<br><br>"Because I need to solve it myself without advice to grow stronger."<br><br>Others' advice only helps momentarily. Finding the solution yourself leads to faster and higher progress.<br><br>"Hahahahaha!"<br><br>Darkan burst into laughter while holding his forehead.<br><br>"I really did judge this one right!"<br><br>He turned to Glenn with a broad smile.<br><br>"You've raised one hell of a grandson! Who knew I'd find something as enviable as your sword!"<br><br>Darkan pressed his lips together deeply, showing his sincerity.<br><br>"Ahem!"<br><br>Upon hearing Darkan's sincere praise, Glenn's guard dropped and his lips quivered.<br><br>"It's not that much."<br><br>Seeing his ears turn red, he seemed truly happy.<br><br>"Don't mind other things, watch my sword."<br><br>Raon strengthened the variable sword technique in his Fire Spirit before unleashing the flames.<br><br>"Again."<br><br>Darkan called for another repetition, still unsatisfied.<br><br>"Alright."<br><br>Raon extended his left foot forward. He slightly weakened the core variable sword and phantom sword techniques in his Fire Spirit while strengthening the quick sword technique as he thrust his sword forward again. Despite not using much aura, the flames that emerged from the Heavenly Drive's blade bloomed beautifully and spread throughout the training ground.<br><br>While maintaining the beauty and variation inherent in Fire Spirit, the accelerated flame fragments enveloped Darkan before he could even blink.<br><br>The sight resembled the sword of the First Patriarch of Zieghart that he had seen in his memories.<br><br>[Ten Thousand Swords achievement has risen.]<br><br>Perhaps because he had gained understanding on his own, a message appeared indicating his Ten Thousand Swords achievement had increased.<br><br>"Seems you've finally started to feel it."<br><br>For the first time, Darkan said something ressembling a compliment instead of "again."<br><br>"Finally..."<br><br>Just as Raon nodded with a smile, Darkan spoke again.<br><br>"But still, again!"<br><br>He waved his hand, indicating it wasn't enough yet.<br><br>"Hah..."<br><br>Raon pressed his lips tightly and shook his head.<br><br>'This training is no joke either.'<br><br>The unexpected difficulty of the training made his legs weak and his head ache.<br><br>'My mind and body feel as heavy as if they're soaked in water.'<br><br>-Seeing you struggle like this makes me feel so refreshed!<br><br>Wrath giggled while shaking his head.<br><br>-Just think of yourself as dead and keep swinging that sword for a month!<br><br>He waved his hand, suggesting to relieve stress through pain.<br><br>'I don't need to do that...'<br><br>Raon licked his lips and shook his head.<br><br>'I think I have another way to relieve stress...'<br><br>***<br><br>'I'm exhausted.'<br><br>After finishing sword training with Darkan, Raon collapsed at the training ground. Though he had enjoyed a delicious dinner at the main building, his head was still spinning from exerting himself since dawn.<br><br>-What a weakling.<br><br>Wrath smacked his lips and shook his head. His face showed no complaints, suggesting he had enjoyed the meal at the main building.<br><br>"Did you have fun today?"<br><br>Darkan came before him and tilted his chin, asking how the training had been.<br><br>"It wasn't fun, but it was very helpful."<br><br>Raon nodded, saying he had found the path for his future growth.<br><br>"From training with grandfather, I learned how to strengthen my Willpower, and from training with you, I realized the subtle differences in sword techniques."<br><br>He felt certain that if he could endure training with these two for a month, he would reach a new level.<br><br>"If you can truly complete it all, you'll receive appropriate rewards."<br><br>Glenn nodded as if sharing the same thought.<br><br>"Then shall we talk about Soul Sword lastly?"<br><br>Darkan sat beside him and tilted his chin.<br><br>"What do you think Soul Sword is?"<br><br>"A martial art that forges one's soul to cut the enemy's soul."<br><br>Raon explained what he knew about Soul Sword.<br><br>"Then mine isn't a Soul Sword? Since my sword doesn't kill the enemy."<br><br>Darkan tilted his chin as if asking if that was really correct.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Raon let out a low groan.<br><br>"You shouldn't think of Soul Sword as just a martial art."<br><br>Glenn calmly shook his head.<br><br>"First think about what you can show through your Soul Sword."<br><br>He turned away after leaving those words.<br><br>"It's the first day, so let's stop here for today."<br><br>Glenn waved his hand, telling him to think it over well.<br><br>"We really click well. How about we become friends? What year were you born?"<br><br>Darkan followed after Glenn as if sharing his thoughts.<br><br>"Hah..."<br><br>In the now empty training ground, Raon spat out the dust that had collected in his mouth.<br><br>"Fatigue is building up in my mind."<br><br>After mental training in the morning and repeatedly performing one sword technique in the afternoon, receiving such a puzzling homework made his head throb even more.<br><br>-Seeing you in pain makes me so happy!<br><br>Wrath wagged his tail, pleased at seeing Raon's struggles.<br><br>-Still, if you endure, you'll get used to...<br><br>'No, I don't need to endure.'<br><br>Raon let out a cold laugh as he left the Head of House's training ground and ran to the fifth training ground.<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>"Palace Master. Why are you here?"<br><br>"Weren't you training with the Head of House?"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace Swordsmen who had been training leisurely widened their eyes at seeing him.<br><br>"I learned some interesting training today."<br><br>A red madness blazed in Raon's eyes.<br><br>"I'd like to teach it to you all."<br><br>Despite his thoughts, he showed a bright smile.<br><br>"Really?"<br><br>"Well, training from the Head of House and the former Leader of the Holy Sword Alliance must be special!"<br><br>"Yes. It won't be just mindlessly swinging swords like we usually do."<br><br>The Light Wind Palace Swordsmen licked their lips in anticipation of his training.<br><br>"Ugh..."<br><br>However, Dorian, reading Raon's terrifying intentions with his Mind's Eye, slowly backed away.<br><br>"I, I need to escape..."<br><br>"Where do you think you're going?"<br><br>Raon had already come down from the platform and put his arm around Dorian's shoulders.<br><br>"Urk!"<br><br>Dorian foamed at the mouth as if about to faint.<br><br>"The very good training I learned..."<br><br>Raon smiled brightly as he raised his chin. His appearance seemed both like an angel descending from heaven and a demon rising from hell.<br><br>"Let's try it together."<br><br>-Hah...<br><br>Wrath gaped as if he hadn't expected Raon to relieve stress on the Light Wind Palace.<br><br>-They say a tiger father begets no dog son, but under the world's greatest sword has emerged the world's greatest madman... {This is the direct translation of the idiom, meaning: A strong, remarkable father will likely have an equally capable or valiant children. I could not think of any idom in english that might have a similar meaning, so I translated it as is.}</p>
