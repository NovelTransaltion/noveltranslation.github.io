        <p>-A n-new title? And it's related to lizards, you say?<br><br>Wrath approached with his eyes wide open in shock.<br><br>-Didn't you already get something like Dragon Slayer before?<br><br>He frowned, asking why the same title was being given again.<br><br>'It's different from that title.'<br><br>Raon waved his hand in front of Wrath's eyes.<br><br>'Dragon Slayer was a title given for killing a dragon for the first time...'<br><br>He continued, pointing to the new title .<br><br>'Dragon Killer is a title earned for killing multiple lizards.'<br><br>Generally, titles like "killer" or "slaughterer" are earned only after killing numerous individuals, not just one or two. It was clear that he had earned the title of Dragon Killer because he had hunted many dragons over time.<br><br>'Come to think of it, I have killed quite a few. Starting with Kaivar, then the three lizards that attacked the Great Forest, and now Dsiouros today.'<br><br>He thought he might be the person who had killed the most dragons among those remaining on the continent.<br><br>'With this many, it's not bad to receive the Killer title, right?'<br><br>-Grrrr...<br><br>Wrath, seemingly at a loss for words, could only clench his trembling fists.<br><br>'If you understand, quiet down so I can check the rewards.'<br><br>Raon pushed away Wrath, who was shaking like a candle in the wind.<br><br>-I refuse! This is my mouth, and I'll use it as I please!<br><br>Wrath screamed, making it clear he had no intention of being quiet.<br><br>'Even kids wouldn't behave like this...'<br><br>Raon shook his head and checked the reward message once again.<br><br>[You have successfully hunted an Ancient Dragon.]<br><br>[All stats increase by 10 points.]<br><br>[The rank of trait increases.]<br><br>[The rank of trait increases.]<br><br>[New title is created.]<br><br>Perhaps because he had fully utilized Glacier's cold energy and Wrath's anger in today's battle, two traits related to authority had increased. Since both authority-related traits were previously low, this reward alone was satisfying.<br><br>'Of course, the points are a bit stingy.'<br><br>Unlike the times when stats increased by 30 or 50 points, the fact that they only increased by 10 points this time was a bit disappointing.<br><br>Given how high his current stats were, an increase of just 10 points didn't feel like a significant difference.<br><br>-Are you out of your mind!<br><br>Wrath gritted his teeth as he thrust his face forward.<br><br>-All you did was cut through a breath attack, what more do you want?<br><br>He screamed that even the reward just received was excessive.<br><br>'Well, that's true.'<br><br>Raon smiled and smacked his lips.<br><br>'I did do less than usual, after all.'<br><br>Unlike times when he handled every situation from start to finish, he only stepped in once this time, so the smaller reward was understandable.<br><br>'That System really is fair, isn't it?'<br><br>-F-fair? Faaaair?<br><br>Wrath's eyes trembled violently.<br><br>-I want to rip open that flowery head of yours! How is it fair when it's constantly showering you with rewards? My true form is now nothing but bones and skin!<br><br>He gnashed his teeth, declaring that he'd destroy the System as soon as he returned to the Devildom.<br><br>'Let's think about that later...'<br><br>Ignoring the enraged Wrath, Raon checked the last floating title. <br><br>[ A title given to Martial Artists who have killed five or more dragons. It generates an aura that allows the bearer and surrounding Martial Artists to more easily cut through dragon scales and mana. The title's bearer exudes an aura that instills fear in dragons.]<br><br>Raon's eyes widened as he read the description of the title.<br><br>'This is pretty good, isn't it?'<br><br>The fact that not only he gained the ability to cut through dragon scales and mana, but could also pass it on to those around him was honestly nothing short of cheating. With this ability, it seemed like even the swordsmen of the Light Wind Palace alone could take down most mature dragons.<br><br>‘Having an ability only I can possess isn’t bad either.’<br><br>Dragons, as mediators of the world, possess an ability called Dragon Fear that suppresses the souls of other races. The title, in turn, created a power that instills fear in dragons who have forgotten their role as mediators. It was essentially a mandate to eliminate all dragons who had lost their divine purpose.<br><br>-How can a title's abilities be this diverse?<br><br>Wrath furrowed his brow, questioning why the abilities were so varied.<br><br>-Don't you dare mention fairness again, you dog-grass-eating fool!<br><br>He gnashed his teeth, claiming that the System was recklessly generous.<br><br>-Since the System is protecting you, I should interfere...<br><br>'Think about it carefully.'<br><br>Raon nudged Wrath with his elbow.<br><br>‘If the Light Wind Palace and I keep hunting dragons, who will eat that meat? Huh?’<br><br>-I-I suppose I would eat it...<br><br>'That's right! Instead of interfering, you should be helping more.'<br><br>Raon nodded, saying that if Wrath wanted to eat various grilled lizard dishes, he should help the Light Wind Palace instead of interfering.<br><br>-You're right. I should be helping!<br><br>Wrath's eyes widened as he fully grasped the idea.<br><br>-Then what are we waiting for! Hurry back and train those fellows!<br><br>He waved his round hands, suggesting they should train everyone to be capable of catching at least one dragon each.<br><br>'That might be difficult...'<br><br>-What's so difficult about it! If you try, anything is possible!<br><br>Wrath puffed out a long breath through his nose, saying he would help.<br><br>'Haah...'<br><br>Raon let out a heavy sigh as he looked at the excited Wrath.<br><br>'If Derus were as simple-minded as this guy, the war would have been over by now.'<br><br>It was truly a confusing world where the so-called Demon King of Wrath was so naive, while the swordsman known as the Sky Sword Saint turned out to be a vicious demon.<br><br>"Palace Master!"<br><br>As Raon was recalling Derus's distorted eyes, Dorian burst out from Dsiouros's collapsed lair.<br><br>"I've gathered everything!"<br><br>Dorian waved his hand, saying he had collected all the treasures from the lair.<br><br>"Already?"<br><br>"Yes. Thanks to everyone's help, we were able to move quickly!"<br><br>He nodded, explaining that with the help of Latiru and the other dwarves, they were able to collect all the treasures from the lair. Given how little time it took, it seemed there weren't as many treasures as expected.<br><br>"I've never seen a pouch like that before."<br><br>"How can such volume fit in such a small space..."<br><br>"Is it an ancient artifact?"<br><br>The dwarves seemed more interested in the pouch than in Dorian himself, smacking their lips as they looked at him.<br><br>"Let's save the curiosity and inspection for later, and get going for now."<br><br>Raon nodded, looking at the sun still high in the sky.<br><br>"To Zieghart."<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>"Hmm."<br><br>External Commander Illiune blinked blankly.<br><br>"Somehow, it feels like the number of people increases every time you return from a mission..."<br><br>He let out a sigh as he examined the hostages from Dsiouros standing behind Raon and the Light Wind Palace.<br><br>"These are people who were kidnapped by the dragon. We brought them back since their entire village has already disappeared."<br><br>Illiune, being in charge of Zieghart's external affairs, was explained the situation of the people behind them.<br><br>"You've been through a lot."<br><br>Illiune nodded heavily after examining the appearance of the dwarves and people.<br><br>“Even without such a story, I trust the words of the Palace Master.”<br><br>He nodded calmly, as if to show his trust. Given that he continued to use respectful language as he had before, it seemed he genuinely trusted Raon.<br><br>"Please enter."<br><br>After counting the number of hostages, Illiune opened the main gate of Zieghart.<br><br>"Thank you. If anything happens, I'll take responsibility."<br><br>Raon bowed his head, expressing his gratitude.<br><br>"No. Since I let them in, it's my responsibility."<br><br>Illiune laughed heartily, saying that matters concerning Zieghart's main gate were his responsibility. Just seeing that smile made one feel a surge of fondness for him.<br><br>"Has the Head of House returned?"<br><br>"He returned a week ago. I've notified him in advance, so he should be waiting."<br><br>Illiune nodded, saying they could go directly to the Lord's Manor.<br><br>"Well then."<br><br>After politely bowing to Illiune, Raon headed up the main road leading to the Lord's Manor.<br><br>"Is this Zieghart?"<br><br>"It seems larger than what we've heard about."<br><br>"Sharp sword aura can be felt from all directions. No wonder it's a renowned sword family."<br><br>The dwarves and people who had been held hostage by Dsiouros seemed to be in awe of Zieghart's scale and power, letting out exclamations with each step they took.<br><br>"It's the Light Wind Palace."<br><br>"They said they went to catch a dragon, did they fail?"<br><br>"No. Judging by the rescued dwarves and people, they must have succeeded!"<br><br>"They killed a hidden Ancient Dragon and returned this quickly?"<br><br>"That's insane. Isn't the Light Wind Palace currently ranked first in performance?"<br><br>"The Central Martial Palace and Wise Martial Palace are still higher. But they might catch up soon..."<br><br>On the contrary, Zieghart's swordsmen revealed shocked expressions, seemingly surprised by the Light Wind Palace's quick mission completion.<br><br>"Come on, this is nothing."<br><br>"Yeah, it's just the basics. Basics!"<br><br>"Hehehe..."<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen squirmed like worms, seemingly pleased with the praise from others.<br><br>'They've already loosened up. Anyway... Hm?'<br><br>As Raon turned his gaze while chuckling, he noticed Latiru. His expression was as grave as if he were being led to a slaughterhouse.<br><br>"Latiru? Are you alright?"<br><br>He bent his knees and lowered his waist to meet Latiru's gaze.<br><br>"Are you feeling unwell somewhere?"<br><br>"No, I'm not in pain. It's just..."<br><br>Latiru swallowed hard as he looked at the approaching Lord's Manor of Zieghart.<br><br>"I was thinking about the Destructive King of the North."<br><br>"You mean the Head of House?"<br><br>"Yes. I've heard that Glenn Zieghart is a cold-hearted king who wouldn't shed a drop of blood even if stabbed with a sword. I don't know how to persuade someone with the title of Destructive King of the North..."<br><br>He seemed to be racking his brain, trying to figure out how to ask for not just himself, but also the other dwarves and people to be accepted into Zieghart.<br><br>"Well, you probably don't need to worry too much."<br><br>Raon smiled and shook his head.<br><br>"He's changed a lot since the time he was known by that title, the Destructive King of the North."<br><br>"R-really?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>He nodded to Latiru, who was staring with wide eyes.<br><br>"These days, the titles used for the Head of House are Lightning God or Sword God. While it might seem like he's grown more distant from humanity, he's actually become more human than before."<br><br>Raon explained that Latiru would be able to feel it when he saw Glenn in person, as they entered the Lord's Manor.<br><br>"As the Palace Master says, there shouldn't be any problems."<br><br>Burren smiled, saying things would work out well.<br><br>"The Head of House will accept you readily, so prepare yourself to work."<br><br>Martha patted Latiru's shoulder, telling him not to doubt.<br><br>"Tell him you'll become a slave..."<br><br>Runaan nodded, saying he'd be accepted if he worked hard.<br><br>"Show some respect to your elders!"<br><br>Burren frowned at Runaan and Martha, pleading with them not to embarrass the Light Wind Palace.<br><br>"I'm still a bit scared of the Head of House..."<br><br>Dorian swallowed hard, saying that the fear he felt since childhood was still lingering.<br><br>"This one's just a coward. Really, there's no need to worry!"<br><br>Krein pushed Latiru and the dwarves' backs, saying they'd naturally understand once they entered the audience chamber.<br><br>'I understand their concern, but...'<br><br>Raon felt the worry of Latiru and the dwarves following behind and gave a faint smile.<br><br>'It's true that the Head of House has changed.'<br><br>The old Glenn might not have accepted them into Zieghart even after hearing their story. But the current Glenn is a Sword God with a human heart. He would likely comfort them and readily accept them into the family. Raon entered the wide-open audience chamber, imagining a smiling Glenn.<br><br>"The Light Wind Palace has returned. Head of House... Hm?"<br><br>As he was about to report their return and greet Glenn, Raon noticed that Glenn's expression was darkly frozen.<br><br>"Huh!"<br><br>"Ugh..."<br><br>"A-as expected of the Destructive King of the North..."<br><br>The dwarves and people swallowed hard at the rough aura emanating from Glenn.<br><br>"Mmm..."<br><br>Latiru bit his lip, thinking that Glenn's expression matched exactly what he had imagined during his worrying.<br><br>"Head of House?"<br><br>Raon's eyes widened in confusion.<br><br>"Did something happen while we were away?"<br><br>His heart trembled, as it was an expression he hadn't seen on Glenn recently.<br><br>"Yes, something did."<br><br>Glenn nodded heavily.<br><br>"You're too late!"<br><br>He frowned, asking why they hadn't contacted him if they were going to be late. The entire Lord's Manor shook as if it might collapse, seemingly from the sincerity of his words.<br><br>"Phew, it was hard to hold him back."<br><br>"Hahaha..."<br><br>Sheryl and Roenn shook their heads, saying Glenn had almost gone to that desert himself.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>Raon's mouth fell open as he looked at Glenn with deeply furrowed brows.<br><br>-Sigh...<br><br>Wrath let out a long sigh, as if he had expected this.<br><br>-That doting old man is at it again.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>"...And that's how we killed the Spear Dragon Dsiouros and returned with these people."<br><br>After finishing his account, Raon slowly raised his gaze. Glenn's previously rigid expression had softened, melting like spring snow.<br><br>'It seems his discomfort has passed.'<br><br>Glenn nodded with a satisfied look in his eyes, seeming simply pleased with Raon and the Light Wind Palace's achievements. It was as if all his irritation and gloominess had been wiped away.<br><br>"I see. Well done."<br><br>Glenn nodded calmly.<br><br>"Especially the Light Wind Palace. It couldn't have been easy to face an Ancient Dragon with your strength alone. Impressive."<br><br>He even clapped his hands, saying they had done really well.<br><br>"N-no, not at all. We just followed the Palace Master's instructions well..."<br><br>Burren hurriedly bowed, seemingly flustered by the direct praise.<br><br>"We did have the Palace Master's help, but we're quite strong ourselves!"<br><br>Martha raised her nose slightly, as if showing off a bit.<br><br>"It was easy..."<br><br>Runaan nodded blankly, as if she truly meant it rather than boasting. Although all three gave different answers, none could hide their joy at receiving praise from Glenn.<br><br>"Then, did you bring Dsiouros's corpse as well?"<br><br>Glenn looked at Raon with curiosity.<br><br>"Yes. Though many scales have been cut off, its body is so large that there will be plenty of usable parts."<br><br>Raon nodded, adding that they hadn't yet separated the Dragon Heart.<br><br>"Mirtan Village will be busy for a while again."<br><br>Glenn smacked his lips, saying Borgos and Vulcan would have to work hard.<br><br>"There's something I'd like to discuss regarding that."<br><br>Raon approached Glenn's podium and bowed his head.<br><br>"I'd like to request that we accept these people into Zieghart."<br><br>He reached back, gesturing towards Latiru, the dwarves, and the former hostages.<br><br>"As I mentioned, they were all captured by Dsiouros and have been crafting jewels and gold for a long time. Their ability to handle heat and their crafting skills were enough to satisfy a dragon, so they could be of great help to us."<br><br>He bowed his head to Glenn, making his request.<br><br>"I-I should have been the one to speak..."<br><br>Latiru bit his lip before approaching Raon's side.<br><br>"I know it's rude to ask another favor from our benefactor who saved our lives. But we want to repay your kindness by doing what we do best."<br><br>He knelt down, pleading for acceptance.<br><br>"Please accept us!"<br><br>The dwarves and people also bowed, crying out for acceptance.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Glenn raised his red eyes, examining each of the former hostages of Dsiouros.<br><br>"Then, can the Light Wind Palace Master take responsibility for their status?"<br><br>He wiggled his finger, as if that was the first priority.<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>Raon closed his eyes, saying he would take full responsibility.<br><br>"Then it's fine."<br><br>Glenn gave a faint smile as he looked at Latiru and the people behind him.<br><br>"Since the Light Wind Palace Master has vouched for your status, I will accept you all into Zieghart."<br><br>He nodded, giving his confirmation in the name of the Head of House.<br><br>"T-thank you!"<br><br>"Thank you so much!"<br><br>Latiru and the dwarves bowed to Glenn, then to Raon as well.<br><br>"It's nothing."<br><br>Raon smiled at Latiru and the others, saying he was just glad it worked out.<br><br>-That old geezer, seriously.<br><br>Wrath wrinkled his nose as he looked at Glenn.<br><br>'What's wrong?'<br><br>-Can't you see through his intentions?<br><br>'Intentions?'<br><br>-He mentioned your name to those hostages, making them feel even more grateful not just to him, but to you as well. I'm telling you, all old folks are sly foxes.<br><br>He lowered his eyebrows, saying he hadn't expected Glenn to use such a tactic.<br><br>'Ah...'<br><br>Raon bit his lip slightly as he looked at Glenn's faint smile. Thinking about it, it really did seem to be as Wrath said.<br><br>"Palace Master."<br><br>Just as Raon was feeling grateful to Glenn, Dorian waved his hand.<br><br>"Shall we take that out?"<br><br>Dorian smacked his lips, as if eager to open his pouch.<br><br>"That?"<br><br>Glenn narrowed his eyes, as if asking what Dorian meant.<br><br>"We have treasures brought from Dsiouros's lair. I hope you can use them as a budget for the war."<br><br>Raon smiled faintly and gestured to Dorian.<br><br>"Then I'll take them out!"<br><br>As Dorian grinned and opened his pouch, gold bars and jewels began pouring out of the black hole like a wave. Before long, more than half of the Lord's Manor was filled with gold bars and jewels, leaving hardly any room for people to stand.<br><br>"W-what is this!"<br><br>"There's so much!"<br><br>"You're saying all of this was acquired this time?"<br><br>The officials widened their eyes in astonishment.<br><br>"Why is there so much!"<br><br>Raon's mouth fell open in surprise. He hadn't been able to check the treasure room while rescuing the hostages, and he hadn't expected this much.<br><br>"I haven't taken everything out yet, you know?"<br><br>Dorian shook his head, saying there were still many gold crafts left.<br><br>"Stop! That's enough."<br><br>Raon waved his hand to close Dorian's pouch when more than half of the audience chamber's pillars were covered.<br><br>"Ahem..."<br><br>Glenn also let out a bewildered cough, seemingly taken aback by the amount of treasure.<br><br>"A-all of this for the war budget?"<br><br>He blinked his eyes in disbelief as he looked at the mountain of gold bars and jewels.<br><br>"Yes. Please accept it. The rest too..."<br><br>"That's enough. The Light Wind Palace can use the remaining treasures."<br><br>When Raon was about to offer more, Glenn waved his hand as if to say it wasn't necessary.<br><br>"R-right."<br><br>"I don't think we'll need any more than this."<br><br>"Yeah. Yeah..."<br><br>The other officials also nodded blankly, seemingly astounded.<br><br>"Alright. Let's leave the rest of the conversation for later. You must be tired, so you may retire for today."<br><br>Glenn waved his hand at Raon and the Light Wind Palace behind the mountain of gold bars.<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>Raon smiled and bowed his head.<br><br>"Then I'll escort these people to Mirtan Village."<br><br>Since he needed to take out the dragon's corpse and talk to Borgos, it seemed best to go there personally.<br><br>"Do that."<br><br>Glenn nodded to Raon with eyes filled with even more pride than before.<br><br>"Well then."<br><br>After bowing to Glenn, Raon led everyone out of the audience chamber.<br><br>"Th-thank you."<br><br>Latiru bowed his head again, expressing his deep gratitude.<br><br>"It was only natural."<br><br>Raon waved his hand, saying there was no need for thanks.<br><br>"I'll guide you to Mirtan right away. However, don't start working immediately when you get there. You need to rest first."<br><br>He insisted that both the dwarves and the humans were exhausted, so they should rest first and think about work later.<br><br>"Hmm, understood. We'll follow our benefactor's words."<br><br>Latiru hesitated, as if he had been thinking of starting work right away, but then nodded.<br><br>"Then let's depart right away. If we leave now, before evening..."<br><br>Just as Raon was about to leave the Lord's Manor and head towards Mirtan Village... A rolled-up piece of paper fell onto his head.<br><br>'What's this?'<br><br>He narrowed his eyes as he looked at the paper. Given that it fell before he could even sense it, it seemed to be an application of teleportation magic.<br><br>'This scent is familiar...'<br><br>Feeling a sense of nostalgia, he unfolded the yellowish paper.<br><br>[Eden's main base. Below the crater at the summit of White Peak Mountain.]<br><br>What was written on the paper was the location of Eden's main base. However, there was nothing else written on it.<br><br>"What is this..."<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he turned the paper over, then froze.<br><br>[Thank you for treating me like a person.]<br><br>From the shaky handwriting, he could sense that person's pure yet intense fragrance.</p>
