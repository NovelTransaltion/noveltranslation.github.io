        <p>"Why are you..."<br><br>Glenn's eyelids trembled, clearly not having expected Darkan to suddenly appear.<br><br>"It's not like I'm forbidden to come here. After all, I played a crucial role in this war."<br><br>Darkan popped a whole grape from the table into his mouth, as if to say everyone knew this better than anyone.<br><br>"Delicious. Befitting of fruit prepared by a noble house."<br><br>He smiled brightly, remarking how even a single piece of fruit was luxurious, as expected of the Zieghart family.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Karoon stared at Darkan with eyes narrowed as sharp as blades.<br><br>"Ah, that crazy bastard..."<br><br>Alice muttered in disbelief as she hit her forehead with her bandaged hand.<br><br>"Is, is that okay? This is an official gathering!"<br><br>"You think that guy cares about such things?"<br><br>"Well, he is one of the few who can speak informally to the Head of House."<br><br>"He was right beside me just a moment ago, when did he get over there? His actions are so unpredictable."<br><br>The Light Wind Palace Swordsmen who knew Darkan's identity heaved deep sighs, as if they had been expecting this.<br><br>"Who is that blind man? Who is he to speak so casually to the Head of House?"<br><br>"I don't know either. I've seen him walking around with the Light Wind Palace Swordsmen, but..."<br><br>"He was at the annex building too. Is he a guest of the Light Wind Palace Master?"<br><br>"Why would a guest of the Light Wind Palace Master speak informally to the Head of House and ask to join the training!"<br><br>Meanwhile, those who didn't know Darkan couldn't understand the situation and stared with wide eyes.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Raon lowered his eyebrows as he observed Darkan's straight back.<br><br>'He certainly has the right to speak that way.'<br><br>If Darkan hadn't stopped Derus Robert, Ogram would have died, and both the Owen Kingdom and Balkar Kingdom might have been destroyed. In the worst-case scenario, Derus could have invaded Zieghart alongside the Heavenly Demon, potentially killing everyone present here.<br><br>It was true that Darkan had played a crucial role, and Raon couldn't speak carelessly since having him join the training could be beneficial.<br><br>-That sword-obsessed fool doesn't know how to read the atmosphere.<br><br>Wrath let out a hollow laugh, wondering how someone like that could exist.<br><br>-If you were to personify the word 'willful,' he would be the perfect embodiment.<br><br>He nodded, saying that fellow would fit right in in the Devildom.<br><br>'No, Darkan understands the atmosphere perfectly well.'<br><br>Raon shook his head as he looked at the plate where Darkan had eaten the grapes.<br><br>'He mentioned how the grapes were delicious and befitting of a noble house. He's hinting that he deserves a reward worthy of such a prestigious family.'<br><br>Darkan pressured Glenn by bringing up the noble house and the Zieghart name. He was suggesting that he deserved a reward for stopping Derus.<br><br>'That man may appear foolish, but he's wiser than anyone.'<br><br>While Darkan acted as if he knew nothing, his actions were infused with confidence in his abilities and instinctive calculation.<br><br>"Everyone, pay it no mind."<br><br>Glenn raised his hand with a calm gaze.<br><br>"He's someone who has earned the right to speak that way."<br><br>He nodded, showing no intention of dismissing Darkan's presence.<br><br>"Come here."<br><br>Glenn gestured to Darkan, as if wanting to speak privately.<br><br>"No."<br><br>Darkan shook his head while remaining in place.<br><br>"Give me your answer here."<br><br>He smiled brightly, saying he wanted to hear the answer in front of everyone.<br><br>'As expected.'<br><br>Raon let out a hollow laugh as he watched Darkan's smile.<br><br>'Darkan is using the banquet hall's atmosphere to his advantage.'<br><br>Since Glenn was attending as the Head of House, he would have to keep his word. Darkan seemed to be counting on this when he declared his desire to train together.<br><br>"Merit-based rewards. Rewards are given based on achievements. Since I stopped Derus Robert, I believe I deserve a reward."<br><br>Darkan even used formal speech as he rubbed his hands together like a fly. He was truly an outrageous person who would do anything for swordsmanship.<br><br>"That, that person stopped Derus Robert?"<br><br>"That young man was the Transcendent who saved the Beast King?"<br><br>"Wh-who on earth is he?"<br><br>The swordsmen at the banquet whispered in growing curiosity about Darkan's identity. Even this curiosity seemed to be part of Darkan's plan.<br><br>"Haaa..."<br><br>Glenn let out a long sigh as he observed Darkan's mischievous smile.<br><br>"Fine. Since you've reached that level, you should be helpful."<br><br>He nodded with a furrowed brow.<br><br>"A good choice!"<br><br>Having achieved his goal, Darkan stomped his feet dramatically and clapped his hands.<br><br>"Let's work together for mutual growth!"<br><br>He stared at Raon gratefully. If he still had his eyeballs, he probably would have winked.<br><br>"Now I'll go enjoy the festival."<br><br>Darkan waved his hand dismissively and returned to the table laden with food.<br><br>"Ex-excuse me, may I ask your name?"<br><br>A swordsman approached Darkan and bowed his head.<br><br>"I've already forgotten my name. Just call me the blind swordsman."<br><br>Darkan waved his hand, saying he had abandoned his name.<br><br>"Wait, do you use a flexible sword?"<br><br>"Y-yes, I do. How did you..."<br><br>The swordsman gaped in surprise at Darkan's words.<br><br>"I want to see it! Let's go outside."<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>"Follow me!"<br><br>Darkan stopped eating mid-bite and left the banquet hall with the True Martial Palace swordsman. He truly lived like a wild beast.<br><br>"There's someone even worse than me."<br><br>Balder snorted, saying he felt tired just watching.<br><br>"Wh-what was that?"<br><br>"I don't know. He's like a storm..."<br><br>"Did he really stop Derus?"<br><br>"The Head of House acknowledged it. That means it must be true."<br><br>The swordsmen's jaws trembled with growing curiosity about Darkan's identity.<br><br>"I'm sorry."<br><br>Glenn approached him and let out a short breath.<br><br>"You must have wanted to learn one-on-one."<br><br>"It's alright."<br><br>Raon calmly shook his head.<br><br>"I'm sure Darkan has his reasons."<br><br>Darkan was a crazy person who wanted his opponents to grow stronger just as much as himself. He clearly wasn't just thinking about what he could gain from Raon and Glenn, but also what he could give.<br><br>'Moreover...'<br><br>Since both his grandfather and Darkan could use Soul Sword at a high level, there would be much to learn. Glenn's Soul Sword and Darkan's Soul Sword were different in nature. Unlike Glenn's Soul Sword, which was honed sharp to kill strong enemies, Darkan's Soul Sword was created for his own desires.<br><br>Because the two Soul Swords were so different in character, he clenched his fist, determined to absorb the advantages of both.<br><br>"I'm glad you think that way."<br><br>Glenn nodded with a faint smile, as if reading his thoughts.<br><br>"However..."<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he looked at Glenn.<br><br>"Why did you say it would be good to collect the Golden Tablets?"<br><br>He couldn't understand why he should collect the Golden Tablets when Sylvia had returned to the direct lineage and he had become a Palace Master.<br><br>"It's still a secret. However..."<br><br>Glenn smiled faintly as he covered his mouth with his finger.<br><br>"You'll know soon enough."<br><br>***<br><br>"Huu."<br><br>After the banquet ended, Glenn returned to the audience chamber and sat on the throne. As soon as he placed his hand on the armrest, blue windows descended from the ceiling with a resonating hum.<br><br>[It's been a while, everyone.]<br><br>Archmage Chamber of Eternal Flame waved her hand. Her fingers trembled slightly, suggesting she still had a headache.<br><br>[*cough* Is, is everyone alright? *cough*]<br><br>Mage Tower Master Larian also coughed repeatedly, suggesting her physical and mental strength hadn't fully recovered.<br><br>[I'm perfectly fine!]<br><br>Despite his words, Ogram had thick bandages wrapped around his abdomen and chest. Though the injuries from Derus remained, he seemed satisfied that his martial prowess was returning.<br><br>[...I'm fine too.]<br><br>King Lecross spoke with difficulty from his bed.<br><br>[You're not supposed to be fine though?]<br><br>Chamber let out a bewildered laugh.<br><br>[I thought I was going to die, so being alive means I'm fine.]<br><br>Lecross nodded gravely, as if he had been prepared to die on the battlefield.<br><br>"Are you really alright?"<br><br>Glenn bit the inside of his lip as he listened to Lecross's shallow breathing.<br><br>[...Actually, I'm not.]<br><br>Lecross spoke in broken fragments.<br><br>[I barely survived, but I don't think I'll be able to stand on the battlefield again.]<br><br>He squeezed his eyes shut, seemingly having failed to move even a single finger.<br><br>[Don't be so definitive. All sorts of things can happen in this world.]<br><br>Chamber shook her head, suggesting that even those injuries might be treatable.<br><br>[Even without wielding a sword, I don't think I have much time left. Before that...]<br><br>Lecross smiled faintly, his eyes still showing unwavering determination.<br><br>[I intend to make my third son a king worthy of Owen's throne.]<br><br>His blue eyes flashed as if he had already decided on his successor.<br><br>[The third? Greer? You're really choosing him?]<br><br>Chamber's eyes widened in surprise.<br><br>[Though his martial prowess is still weak, his capacity keeps growing. Sending him to Zieghart was the right decision.]<br><br>Lecross smiled, saying that Third Prince Greer of Owen had changed for the better after meeting Raon.<br><br>[Come to think of it, I'm alive thanks to Raon too. Please convey my gratitude.]<br><br>"I see..."<br><br>Glenn deeply furrowed his brow despite hearing the praise for Raon.<br><br>[Actually, I was thinking about retiring too...]<br><br>Chamber roughly chewed the lollipop in her mouth.<br><br>[That young one beat me to it, so I can't rest yet.]<br><br>She wrinkled her nose, lamenting that she'd been beaten to the punch.<br><br>"Are you in serious condition too?"<br><br>Glenn narrowed his eyes as he looked at Chamber.<br><br>[Not as bad as Lecross. But the wounds to my upper dantian won't heal easily.]<br><br>Chamber grabbed her forehead, saying she had pushed herself too hard before her upper dantian injury had fully healed.<br><br>[I'll need to focus on recovery for a while. Besides, future battles will only get more intense, so I should prepare my successor too.]<br><br>"Do you have someone in mind?"<br><br>[Jayna. If I had met my last disciple earlier, I might have passed it to them, but now Jayna is the right choice.]<br><br>She put the broken lollipop in her mouth, saying she would make Jayna the successor to the Archmage position and pass on many things to her.<br><br>"Yes. That child seems trustworthy."<br><br>Glenn nodded as he remembered how Jayna had perfected long-distance teleportation magic even while shedding tears of blood.<br><br>[I'm still going strong. This is just the beginning!]<br><br>Ogram pounded his pot lid-sized fist against his chest, saying he'd leave the successor business to sort itself out while he focused on the battles ahead.<br><br>[I-I'm still fine too...]<br><br>Despite her trembling voice, Larian showed a clear glint in her eyes as she declared she could still fight.<br><br>"They're split into two pairs."<br><br>Glenn narrowed his eyes as he looked at the two who were planning for successors and the two who showed no such inclination.<br><br>[What about Zieghart? Shouldn't you be thinking about it too?]<br><br>Chamber shrugged her shoulders, suggesting it was obvious.<br><br>[It, it must be Raon, right?]<br><br>Larian traced circles with her fingertips, saying that even as Mage Tower Master, she had to acknowledge Raon as a swordsman.<br><br>[Whether in martial prowess or character, Raon is perfect!]<br><br>Ogram raised his fist in agreement.<br><br>[Hmm...]<br><br>Lecross let out a low groan, as if even looking in their direction was taxing.<br><br>[Let's not jump to conclusions. All sorts of things can happen in this world.]<br><br>Chamber waved her hand, suggesting they should contact each other formally soon.<br><br>[P-please avoid daytime. I need to sleep...]<br><br>Larian clasped her hands, asking them to contact her at night as her sleep schedule seemed reversed.<br><br>[Lecross. Focus on your recovery and come back. I'll keep your seat warm.]<br><br>Ogram nodded heavily, saying he would hold out until Lecross recovered his martial prowess and returned.<br><br>[Yes. I'll be counting on you.]<br><br>Lecross managed a faint smile, seeming somewhat strengthened by Ogram's warm words.<br><br>[Well then.]<br><br>With Chamber's gesture, the four blue windows floating in the air disappeared.<br><br>"A successor..."<br><br>Glenn turned his gaze to the moon rising in the center of the sky.<br><br>"Of course I've thought about it. But I won't give it up easily."<br><br>He curled his lips upward, thinking of his son and grandson who would be swinging their swords even at this hour.<br><br>"Come up here. I'll be waiting here until you both prove yourselves worthy."<br><br>***<br><br>Raon breathed in the dawn air as he headed to the Head of House's training ground. Opening the side door instead of the large main gate with a creak, he saw Glenn wrapped in the white dawn mist like a cloud. Though Glenn seemed to sense his presence, he remained motionless in meditation.<br><br>To avoid disturbing him, Raon silently walked over, closed his eyes, and emptied his mind.<br><br>Just as he stabilized his mind and spirit and was about to begin his aura training, the ground suddenly shook. With a thunderous rumble, the main gate of the training ground - normally used only for ceremonies - was forced open, and Darkan entered through it.<br><br>"Why won't this door open properly!"<br><br>Darkan frowned, saying the training ground's door needed oiling.<br><br>"No..."<br><br>Raon's jaw trembled.<br><br>"There's a perfectly good door right there!"<br><br>He pointed vigorously at the side door.<br><br>"A swordsman uses the grand gate, not the small door!"<br><br>Darkan shook his head vigorously, as if this was obvious.<br><br>"Who decided that?"<br><br>"I, Dark Night Sword God Darkan!"<br><br>He was so brazenly confident, as if he owned the place, that Raon was left speechless. Moreover, despite claiming to have forgotten his name and title, he now proudly proclaimed them. He was simply insane.<br><br>-I wonder how that guy's brain is wired...<br><br>Wrath let out a sigh, unable to understand Darkan.<br><br>"Everyone's here."<br><br>Glenn calmly opened his eyes, as if he had predicted Darkan's eccentric behavior.<br><br>"This training is solely for Raon. I don't have time to look after you."<br><br>"I know. I just want to watch."<br><br>Darkan smiled brightly, saying he just wanted to see how teaching and learning happened.<br><br>"Though I have no eyes, of course."<br><br>He tapped his black eyepatch, suggesting he would sense it well enough.<br><br>"Raon. Before we begin training, show me the swordsmanship you've learned."<br><br>Glenn stepped back with his arms crossed, as if to observe how much growth had occurred.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Raon stood in the center of the training ground and drew the Heavenly Drive. With a resonating hum, he demonstrated all the swordsmanship he had learned while facing Glenn and Darkan. Though he wasn't using his aura strongly, the sheer level of his swordsmanship carved into the training ground's floor and brought down a red vortex from the sky.<br><br>With a thunderous crack, Raon's heavy yet fierce swordsmanship tore through the air like a renewed war, shaking the entire training ground. After demonstrating the Whispering Wind with his Wooden Ring Sword, he sheathed both blades.<br><br>"I'm finished."<br><br>He bowed to Glenn, saying he had given it his all.<br><br>"Excellent."<br><br>Glenn nodded, as if it had exceeded his expectations.<br><br>"Your swordsmanship shows how hard you've been working..."<br><br>"This is on a completely different level from when I met you as a beggar! What happened in between!"<br><br>Darkan let out an incredulous laugh.<br><br>"Ngh..."<br><br>Though Glenn was annoyed at being interrupted, he barely held back since it was praise for his grandson.<br><br>"Even 'genius' doesn't do this justice. We might need a new word just for you."<br><br>Darkan continued speaking, paying no attention to Glenn's reaction.<br><br>"Ahem..."<br><br>Glenn's furrowed brow softened, his heart seemingly melted by Darkan's sincere praise for Raon.<br><br>"I'll listen carefully to any shortcomings you've noticed."<br><br>Raon bowed his head to Glenn as he made his request.<br><br>"Your direction of development is correct. You're focusing on the Ten Thousand Swords, not overdoing the techniques, and showing sufficient adaptability. However, the Willpower you imbue into your sword is slightly lacking."<br><br>Glenn shook his head, saying that while the swordsmanship itself was progressing toward completion, the Willpower wasn't keeping up.<br><br>"Huh? I think the opposite."<br><br>Darkan raised his eyebrows while stroking his chin.<br><br>"There's still much room for technical improvement! Though you're learning the Ten Thousand Swords, the techniques aren't perfectly harmonized due to varying skill levels. Your swordsmanship still has room for improvement. However, that guy's soul is strong enough to rival even mine. He can handle the Willpower aspect on his own."<br><br>He waved his hand dismissively, saying there was no need to worry about Willpower since he had seen Raon's soul in the mental world.<br><br>"I'm not saying the swordsmanship is perfect. I'm just saying the Willpower is more important."<br><br>Glenn deeply furrowed his brow.<br><br>"I agree. While the Willpower is lacking, there's more room to develop the swordsmanship."<br><br>Darkan just smiled, as if he enjoyed simply conversing with Glenn.<br><br>"Didn't I tell you not to interfere?"<br><br>"It's interesting how our opinions differ."<br><br>The two Transcendents looked at each other's swords with different expressions.<br><br>"Um..."<br><br>Raon stretched his hand forward to intervene between Glenn and Darkan. Seeing the two of them reminded him of when Glenn and Rector used to fight.<br><br>"Perhaps grandfather could teach me about Willpower, while I learn technical improvements in swordsmanship from Darkan..."<br><br>He looked at both of them in turn, suggesting it would be better to learn what each had advised.<br><br>"I'm fine with that! Teaching helps me learn too."<br><br>Darkan placed his hand on his dark sword in agreement.<br><br>"Your grandfather is far above me in the realm of Willpower anyway."<br><br>He nodded without hesitation, readily acknowledging Glenn.<br><br>"...Alright."<br><br>Glenn closed his eyes briefly before opening them again.<br><br>"No one knows the continent's swordsmanship better than that guy, so he should be helpful."<br><br>Though he didn't like it, he nodded in acceptance.<br><br>"Ah, how about we discuss Soul Sword together?"<br><br>Darkan moved next to Glenn and shrugged his shoulders.<br><br>"For the benefit of all three of us."<br><br>"...Let's do that."<br><br>Glenn thoughtfully stroked his chin, seeming interested in learning about Darkan's Soul Sword.<br><br>"Then shall we hear it before we start the actual training?"<br><br>Darkan turned his attention back to Raon.<br><br>"Have you decided what to imbue in your Soul Sword?"<br><br>He wiggled his finger as if saying 'tell us now.' Raon slowly opened his lips as he looked at Glenn and Darkan, who both showed interested expressions.<br><br>"I..."</p>
