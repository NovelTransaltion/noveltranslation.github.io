        <p>“They say the bead ice cream here is the best on the continent.”<br><br>The black-haired youth, likely a Zieghart swordsman, winked at the blonde woman walking beside him. A soft, warm atmosphere enveloped the pair, hinting at a date.<br><br>“Really?”<br><br>The blonde woman’s eyes widened in surprise.<br><br>“No doubt. In Zieghart, where it’s cold all year round, it sells out every day. They even release new flavors here first because it’s so popular.”<br><br>The dark-haired youth licked his lips and said it was a dessert that had to be tried every vacation.<br><br>“Dessert? We haven’t even had breakfast yet.”<br><br>“That’s why we’re here. If we’re late, we might not get the flavor we want.”<br><br>“Is it that popular?”<br><br>“After missions at the Light Wind Palace, one of the squad leaders always buys ice cream wholesale. So… Oh!”<br><br>He slightly shrugged his shoulders as he opened the door to the ice cream shop, then froze.<br><br>“Ugh…”<br><br>The dark-haired youth trembled all over as if he was about to faint.<br><br>“Honey?”<br><br>“Good day!”<br><br>He bowed deeply towards the tables inside, then slowly backed away.<br><br>“L-let’s go.”<br><br>“But we just got here…”<br><br>“This is no place for people!”<br><br>The dark-haired youth grabbed the blonde woman’s wrist and ran out of the ice cream shop.<br><br>“At least explain why we’re leaving!”<br><br>“That place is forbidden! It’s inhabited by evil spirits!”<br><br>As soon as they left the ice cream shop, he fled, abandoning even his girlfriend.<br><br>“That crazy fool!”<br><br>As the blonde woman kicked in anger, a group of children around twelve years old walked past her.<br><br>“I heard they’ll have honey-coated melon flavor next week.”<br><br>The shortest child licked his lips in anticipation.<br><br>“I don’t like fruit flavors. Chocolate is the best.”<br><br>The child wearing the hat insisted that chocolate ice cream was supreme, wagging his finger.<br><br>“Young people nowadays just don’t know good taste.”<br><br>The shortest child clicked his tongue in disdain.<br><br>“It’s pretty funny to say that from someone who always takes advantage of others.”<br><br>“I bought it for you last week.”<br><br>The children argued as they entered the bead ice cream shop; their relationship was unclear.<br><br>—Sir! We’d like chocolate and… Huh?<br><br>“Eep!”<br><br>However, as soon as the two children crossed the threshold of the shop, they froze like statues in front of a school.<br><br>“We’ll come back later.”<br><br>“Y-yes…”<br><br>The shortest child and the one wearing the hat held each other’s arms as if they had never argued and ran out of the ice cream shop.<br><br>“Children, be careful!”<br><br>Kerin frowned as he dodged the children running like wild animals.<br><br>“Tsk tsk. Children nowadays have no manners. It wasn’t like that in my day.”<br><br>He clicked his tongue sharply, as if he were disappointed.<br><br>“You tried to challenge Lord Raon and were immediately defeated.”<br><br>Dorian smiled as he patted Kerin on the shoulder.<br><br>“T-that was when I was young!”<br><br>“So you were also ill-mannered when you were young.”<br><br>He waved his hand and said that all children were the same.<br><br>“We were about the same age back then. It wasn’t a matter of manners…”<br><br>Kerin wrinkled his nose, apparently remembering the first time Raon defeated him.<br><br>“Anyway, why did you want to come here?”<br><br>Dorian lifted his chin and looked at the ice cream shop sign.<br><br>“I think this place might hold a secret.”<br><br>“A secret?”<br><br>“Yes. Whenever they return to Zieghart, the Palace Master or Squad Leader Runaan always stop by this shop. The secret to their strength might be in this ice cream.”<br><br>Kerin suggested they go in and see for themselves, opening the door to the ice cream shop.<br><br>“Oh? It’s the Palace Master! Look, just like I said, he’s always… Ah!”<br><br>He greeted Raon, who was sitting at a table, then his jaw began to tremble.<br><br>“Urge!”<br><br>Dorian also swallowed hard, apparently surprised.<br><br>“Mmm?”<br><br>“Hmm.”<br><br>Karoon and Balder, sitting opposite Raon, turned their heads and frowned. The two of them emitted a fierce aura that suggested they were in a bad mood.<br><br>“We’re leaving now. Enjoy your training!”<br><br>Kerin, with his mind seemingly frozen, wished the three men with ice cream in front of them a pleasant training session before fleeing.<br><br>“I need to check the supplies!”<br><br>Dorian also rushed out of the ice cream shop, apparently uncomfortable with staying.<br><br>“Haa…”<br><br>Raon pushed back the hair that fell over his forehead and sighed deeply.<br><br>‘They’re leaving again.’<br><br>Everyone who entered the ice cream shop fled as soon as they saw Karoon and Balder’s faces. Given their previous conduct and reputation, people seemed to find them simply terrifying.<br><br>“If there’s anything I can help with, please let me know. If there’s anything I can help with…”<br><br>Even the shop owner couldn’t overcome his nervousness and stammered like a broken puppet.<br><br>“Everything is delicious!”<br><br>—This is bliss! When I return to the Devildom, I’ll build a bead ice cream factory! Bigger than your house!<br><br>The only ones laughing now were Sia and Wrath.<br><br>‘This is more serious than I thought.’<br><br>Raon had anticipated this situation when he suggested going to the ice cream shop with Karoon and Balder at the behest of Wrath and Sia, but it was even worse than expected. He hadn’t imagined that everyone who entered the ice cream shop would flee, apologizing, as if an Archmage had created a barrier to block people.<br><br>‘Or is this normal?’<br><br>It wasn’t strange for people to be afraid, given that three of the four Palace Masters of Zieghart were gathered here.<br><br>“And they’re not sitting in silence.”<br><br>Karoon and Balder emitted a fierce aura, showing their displeasure at being there. It was natural for ordinary people to feel uncomfortable with these large men who frowned. The door chimed as someone entered the ice cream shop while Raon shook his head.<br><br>They’ll probably leave too.<br><br>Thinking that the newcomer would leave immediately, Raon turned his head, but the person at the entrance simply stared at him blankly.<br><br>“Runnan?”<br><br>The person who had entered the ice cream shop was Runaan. She seemed to have come to have pearl ice cream, as usual.<br><br>“Hello.”<br><br>Runaan simply nodded her head towards Raon, Karoon, and Balder, then went to choose her ice cream as if nothing was happening. As always, she had a strong sense of self.<br><br>“What are you going to order? This is delicious.”<br><br>Sia approached Runaan and recommended the ice creams she had enjoyed.<br><br>“This is the best.”<br><br>True to her decisive nature, Runaan immediately chose chocolate mint.<br><br>—As expected of the ice cream girl! A choice worthy of my superior subordinate!<br><br>Wrath nodded, proud of having chosen a good subordinate.<br><br>‘When did Runaan become your main subordinate?’<br><br>Raon sighed as he suppressed Wrath’s excitement.<br><br>“This isn’t bad at all. It could even serve as a snack.”<br><br>Balder licked his lips and said he should buy bead ice cream wholesale for the True Martial Palace.<br><br>“The flavor isn’t bad, but it’s too sweet to eat often.”<br><br>Karoon narrowed his eyes slightly, suggesting that, as a martial artist, it would be better to exercise moderation.<br><br>“You two.”<br><br>Raon turned to Karoon and Balder.<br><br>“Are we starting already? What did you want to discuss that brought you to the annex building this morning?”<br><br>He nodded and ate the rest of the chocolate mint ice cream.<br><br>“Hmm!”<br><br>Balder gulped down the pearl ice cream in the bowl and stomped his foot. The entire ice cream shop trembled because of his large size, even without using his aura.<br><br>“That’s right! To be held back in this way is not befitting of me, the True Martial Palace Master!”<br><br>Balder leaned forward with his bear-like upper body, as if he had made a decision.<br><br>—Nephew, I have a favor to ask.<br><br>“Yes. Please, go ahead.”<br><br>Raon nodded calmly, having anticipated a request.<br><br>“Create a martial art that suits me!”<br><br>Balder clasped his hands as if he were begging.<br><br>“If you create one for me, I’ll grant you anything you desire!”<br><br>“Mmm…”<br><br>Raon tilted his head and looked at Balder, whose hands trembled with desperation.<br><br>“Wouldn’t it be better to ask the Head of House about creating a new martial art?”<br><br>Although he himself could create martial arts, he was not on Glenn’s level. He didn’t understand why Balder was asking him to do it.<br><br>“My father’s martial arts are too advanced and don’t suit me. On the other hand, the martial arts you create are simpler but more precise. I want to use the swordsmanship you create!”<br><br>Balder clenched his fist and said that Raon’s martial arts were more to his liking. Karoon abruptly dropped the spoon he was holding.<br><br>“You’re asking our nephew to create a martial art for you? You’ve gone mad.”<br><br>He frowned as if Balder were pathetic.<br><br>“Don’t you know shame?”<br><br>“What shame! My nephew is stronger than me! If I have such a talented nephew, why can’t I ask him for help?”<br><br>Balder snorted, saying he didn’t feel shame at all.<br><br>—Then what were you going to say after so much hesitation? Speak louder instead of mumbling!<br><br>He lifted his chin and told Karoon to get to the point.<br><br>“Alright…”<br><br>Karoon looked slightly at Raon.<br><br>“I…”<br><br>He nodded slightly as if he had made a decision.<br><br>“I want to spar with you.”<br><br>“…A spar?”<br><br>Raon’s eyes widened as he looked at Karoon.<br><br>‘A spar all of a sudden.’<br><br>He had anticipated Balder’s request, but he hadn’t expected Karoon to ask for a spar. He involuntarily let out a gasp.<br><br>“I learned a lot observing you in the last war. I want to confirm what I’ve learnt with a spar.”<br><br>Karoon nodded, saying that was his request.<br><br>“Ha!”<br><br>Balder slammed his fist on the table and twisted his lips into a smile.<br><br>“You call me a guy who uses his nephew, and yet, here you are, brother, doing the same thing!”<br><br>He clicked his tongue and wagged his finger.<br><br>“You tried to openly hit our nephew! Were you so jealous that Raon beheaded the Black Tower Master?”<br><br>Balder snorted, saying that a man’s jealousy was too ugly.<br><br>“I just want a fair spar. And if we fight now, who knows who will win!”<br><br>Karoon shook his head firmly, saying it was completely different.<br><br>“The same thing happens to me! I just want to justly request that a martial art be created!”<br><br>Balder slapped down, insisting it was the same.<br><br>“How is it the same?”<br><br>“In the end, it’s all the same!”<br><br>Karoon and Balder glared at each other. They were true brothers; their profiles were exactly the same as they argued.<br><br>“Please don’t fight.”<br><br>Raon pushed his hand between the two.<br><br>“First, I will grant the True Martial Palace Master’s request. Please tell me what kind of martial art you desire.”<br><br>While it was true that his first impression of Balder had been terrible, he was simply a straightforward man. Given the help he had received and the favors he owed, Raon could at least create the martial art Balder wanted.<br><br>“You know what you’re good at! The swordsmanship that destroys everything in one blow! Make it so I can use it with a flexible sword!”<br><br>Balder uses a long, flexible sword that doesn’t suit his large size. It seemed he wanted a martial art that could unleash the power of techniques like the Flame Dragon Strike or the Heavy Heavenly Cannon with a flexible sword.<br><br>“I understand. However, I need to enter the Chamber of Self next week, so it will take some time.”<br><br>—Don’t worry! I’m good at waiting!<br><br>Balder said he could wait, but his legs were already trembling. He seemed excited.<br><br>“Chamber of Self?”<br><br>Karoon narrowed his eyes as if he were surprised.<br><br>“Are you going to enter now? It doesn’t seem like a good option.”<br><br>He frowned, seeming to share Glenn’s opinion that entering now wasn’t ideal.<br><br>“I’m not sure when, if ever, I’ll surpass Transcendence. I’d like to participate while I have the chance.”<br><br>“You’ve overcome the walls on your own so far…”<br><br>Karoon nodded, seeming to think it wasn’t a bad idea after all.<br><br>“Then it will be difficult to spar.”<br><br>“No. Let’s do it.”<br><br>Raon smiled as he looked at Karoon’s red eyes, which were becoming clearer.<br><br>“But twice.”<br><br>“Twice?”<br><br>Karoon tilted his head as if he didn’t understand.<br><br>“Yes. I’d like to train twice: once before entering the Chamber of Self and once after I come out.”<br><br>“…You want to measure how much you’ve improved using me as a benchmark?”<br><br>He chuckled as if he finally understood Raon’s words.<br><br>“If you accept?”<br><br>Raon awaited Karoon’s answer with his hands clasped on the table with holes.<br><br>“…Very well.”<br><br>Karoon nodded as he put down the empty ice cream cup.<br><br>“I accept.”<br><br>He licked his lips as if he were looking forward to it. A giant ice cream stood between Raon and Karoon as their gazes clashed intensely.<br><br>“I chose this with Runaan! Let’s all eat together!”<br><br>Sia greeted everyone and said it would taste better if they ate together.<br><br>“Ahem…”<br><br>“Ah…”<br><br>Raon and Karoon blushed as if they suddenly remembered they were in a brightly lit ice cream shop with cheerful wallpaper.<br><br>“L-let’s eat then.”<br><br>Raon picked up a spoon and smiled awkwardly.<br><br>“…Indeed.”<br><br>Karoon also nodded, lowering his gaze slightly.<br><br>“Ugh…”<br><br>The shop owner swallowed his tears as he watched the scene.<br><br>‘When will these people leave…?’<br><br>Business was good, but he felt like he was suffocating.<br><br>‘This is an ice cream shop for children! Why are they causing such a ruckus here?’<br><br>***<br><br>After leaving the ice cream shop, Karoon entered the audience chamber.<br><br>“I have requested a spar with the Light Wind Palace Master.”<br><br>He bowed to Glenn, who was sitting on the throne with a bored expression.<br><br>“I knew you would.”<br><br>Glenn nodded as if he had expected it.<br><br>“I could see the thirst in your eyes.”<br><br>“However, there’s something even you don’t know, Head of House.”<br><br>Karoon raised his hand and lifted two fingers.<br><br>“Raon suggested we spar twice.”<br><br>“Twice?”<br><br>Glenn narrowed his eyes as if asking what he meant.<br><br>—Yes. Once before entering the Chamber of Self and once after. He seems to intend to use me as a test subject.<br><br>Karoon smiled slightly and said he had gone to make a request but ended up being used instead.<br><br>“That’s very Raon-like.”<br><br>Glenn burst into laughter, leaning back on the throne as if he hadn’t anticipated Raon’s actions.<br><br>“As you know, Head of House, I desire that seat more than anyone.”<br><br>Karoon pointed at the golden throne Glenn was sitting on.<br><br>“I had planned to leave the family if anyone other than me became the head. However…”<br><br>He lowered his chin slightly and looked towards the darkening window.<br><br>“If someone worthy becomes the head, I believe I could accept serving under him.”<br><br>“Karoon…”<br><br>Glenn’s eyes widened as he understood the meaning behind Karoon’s words.<br><br>“Of course, I have no intention of voluntarily giving up. I will spill blood and flesh, crush my soul, to ascend to that position.”<br><br>Karoon bit his lip as he looked at the golden throne. A fierce heat took over his eyes, which had always been cold.<br><br>“I’ll see you at the training ground tomorrow.”<br><br>Karoon turned and left the Lord’s Mansion, as if he had said everything he needed to say.<br><br>“I thought it would be a shame to hand it over to someone…”<br><br>Glenn ran his hand over the throne Karoon had been looking at, licking his lips.<br><br>“Now I could welcome either outcome.”<br><br>He smiled slightly, as if he were looking forward to what was to come.<br><br>Although I’m not sure if I’ll live to see it…<br><br>***<br><br>The next day, at noon, Raon entered the Head of House’s training ground with a calm stride. There were only four people on the training ground: Glenn, Alice, Denier, and Balder.<br><br>“Greetings, Head of House.”<br><br>Raon approached Glenn and bowed.<br><br>“Don’t waste your energy on greetings.”<br><br>Glenn waved his hand, as if telling Raon to prepare for the spar.<br><br>“Nephew! Beat that arrogant man today!”<br><br>Balder stomped his foot and told Raon to easily defeat Karoon.<br><br>“Let’s see the skills of the Sword Emperor who beheaded the Black Tower Master.”<br><br>Alice licked her lips, her arms crossed.<br><br>“A spar between Transcendants is a rare sight, even with a price. I look forward to it.”<br><br>Denier smiled slightly as he stepped back.<br><br>‘Denier…’<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he observed Denier.<br><br>‘Is he here to scout?’<br><br>It was a bit irritating. Unlike the others, Denier was an inscrutable entity. Raon wanted to openly question him, but since Denier hadn’t done anything suspicious, he had to remain silent for now.<br><br>—Then I’ll have to demonstrate overwhelming power that renders his observation useless.<br><br>Perhaps it wouldn’t be bad to show such overwhelming power that even Denier wouldn’t be able to glean anything useful.<br><br>“I only invited a few people since this is a spar between Palace Masters.”<br><br>Glenn climbed onto the platform and told Raon to focus only on the fight.<br><br>“Thank you.”<br><br>As Raon bowed to Glenn, the door to the training ground opened and Karoon entered. Karoon stepped onto the training ground, his piercing gaze flashing with a chilling light. His eyes were so intense that Raon’s skin prickled as if it had been cut with a blade.<br><br>“Are you ready?”<br><br>Karoon’s fingertips were already red, suggesting he had warmed up before running.<br><br>“Of course.”<br><br>Raon said he was ready to begin immediately, placing his hand on the hilt of the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>“Good.”<br><br>Karoon nodded in approval and gripped the hilt of his sword. Raon and Karoon stood motionless like statues in a space where they could touch if they reached out. A cold sweat beaded on the foreheads of the two swordsmen as a giant hawk soared from the direction of North Grave Mountain.<br><br>As the hawk passed over the training ground, it cast a small shadow.<br><br>In that instant, Raon and Karoon simultaneously unsheathed their swords and swung them towards each other’s necks. A deafening clash rang out as the two swords collided.<br><br>“Today I will see your limits.”<br><br>Karoon pressed the hand holding his sword. His sword sank as if it were about to pierce Raon’s neck.<br><br>“I’m sorry, but my depths are profound.”<br><br>As Raon raised his wrist, Karoon’s sword, which was pressing hard against it, began to slowly retreat. His scarlet eyes shone as brightly as the flames of Heavenly Drive, and he twisted his lips.<br><br>“If you want to see my limits, you’ll have to bet your life, Palace Master.”&nbsp;</p>
