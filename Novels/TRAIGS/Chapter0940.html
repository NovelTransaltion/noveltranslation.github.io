        <p>The Staff's Resting Place, erected in the center of the Balkar capital.<br><br>The quaint teahouse, which had been open for over a hundred years, was bustling with magicians dressed in colorful robes and ceremonial attire.<br><br>Instead of enjoying the aroma of tea with their elegant demeanor, the magicians were raising their voices as if they were in a tavern on the back streets, celebrating the victory of the war.<br><br>“I never thought the Black Tower would fall.”<br><br>A middle-aged wizard in a red robe laughed hollowly.<br><br>“I can't believe it either. Those leeches just disappeared all at once...”<br><br>The blond knight sitting across from him nodded.<br><br>“If I had known this would happen, I should have gone with them somehow.”<br><br>He seemed to regret not participating in the war.<br><br>“Actually, I thought this expedition would fail...”<br><br>The middle-aged mage stroked his teacup with his fingers and shook his head.<br><br>“You thought it would fail?”<br><br>The blond knight blinked his eyes in disbelief.<br><br>“Yes. I saw the Black Tower Lord with my own eyes.”<br><br>The middle-aged wizard's fingers trembled, and the tea in the cup spilled out.<br><br>“The danger of the Black Tower Lord is not only because of his strength. He never reveals his true form. He always hides his power and leaves himself a way to retreat.”<br><br>He continued, frowning.<br><br>“Chamber said she was confident she could defeat him, but I thought that just driving the Black Tower away would be a success for this expedition.”<br><br>The middle-aged wizard lowered his eyebrows, saying that not only he, but other wizards also shared the same opinion.<br><br>“Certainly, the Black Tower has often caused us harm while retreating without suffering any damage itself.”<br><br>The blond knight nodded as if he understood what he was saying.<br><br>“If that's the case, the Black Tower Lord must have made a way to escape from the Black Tower. There must have been more escape routes than rabbit holes.”<br><br>The middle-aged mage chewed his lips as he recalled the Black Tower Lord's insidiousness.<br><br>“So, I believe that the Black Tower collapsed, but I still can't believe that the Black Tower Lord is dead.”<br><br>“Hmm, then is it a lie?”<br><br>The blond knight tapped the table lightly and narrowed his eyes.<br><br>“It could be a benevolent lie fabricated to turn the tide of battle that was going against Five Demons...”<br><br>“That's absolutely not the case.”<br><br>The middle-aged mage shook his head firmly.<br><br>“If it becomes known that the Black Tower Lord is alive, we will lose the trust of the neutral forces. Besides, Lord Chamber is not the kind of person who would lie about the Black Tower Lord's death.”<br><br>He took a sip of tea, saying that he couldn't believe it, but that the Black Tower Lord's death was certain.<br><br>“Then is it really because of Raon Zigehart?”<br><br>The blond knight leaned forward and lowered his voice.<br><br>“Chamber herself admitted it. Raon Zigehart was the one who cut off the Black Tower Lord's neck. We thought he was just finishing the job, but maybe he actually played a major role?”<br><br>He licked his lips, thinking that was closer to the truth.<br><br>“Hmm, in my opinion...”<br><br>“That's not true!”<br><br>Before the middle-aged mage could answer, the young mages at the table behind him stood up roughly, as if they were going to break their chairs.<br><br>“Lord Chamber was just being considerate!”<br><br>“There is a huge gap between transcendents, so how could Raon Zieghart interfere in a battle between two absolute beings?”<br><br>“Since a war hero is needed, they’re probably trying to elevate Raon Zieghart.”<br><br>“It was Chamber who killed the Black Tower Lord!”<br><br>The young magicians, seemingly trusting Chamber, spoke without hesitation about what they believed.<br><br>“Hm…”<br><br>“That does make logical sense.”<br><br>“No matter how strong Raon Zieghart’s power has become, it’s not enough to reach the Black Tower Lord.”<br><br>The blond knight and the others at the tavern nodded in agreement, seeming to share the same thought.<br><br>“Well, everyone has different opinions.”<br><br>The middle-aged mage smiled faintly as he looked at the young mages.<br><br>‘They’re young.’<br><br>No, perhaps it would be more accurate to say they were naive.<br><br>They couldn't believe that Chamber, whom they respected more than anyone else, had fallen and entrusted her final moments to Raon.<br><br>No, it was clear that they didn't want to believe it.<br><br>Those young magicians didn't know Chamber as well as they thought they did. She was dead, but she wasn't the kind of person who would tell such a lie. So they had to be told.<br><br>“Chamber was the greatest magician on the continent, so her pride was sky-high. She often made playful lies, but in such an important matter, she would never bend, even if it meant death.”<br><br>The middle-aged wizard looked around with unwavering eyes.<br><br>“The one who cut off the Black Tower Lord's neck is definitely Raon Ziggart. If what Chamber said is true, he couldn't have defeated the Black Tower Lord alone.”<br><br>He lowered his chin calmly, as if he knew from the rumors alone.<br><br>“How do you know that, senior?”<br><br>“You didn't see it yourself, did you?”<br><br>“He must have just interfered with the fight between Chamber and the Black Tower Lord and only stepped in at the last moment!”<br><br>“If Chamber hadn’t been there, Raon Ziggart’s head would have been severed by a single blow from the Black Tower Lord!”<br><br>The young magicians shook their heads vigorously, as if to say, “How do you know that without even seeing it?”<br><br>“You don’t understand…”<br><br>“That’s enough.”<br><br>As the middle-aged mage gave up and sighed, a woman in a purple robe rose from the table inside.<br><br>“Who are you…?”<br><br>The young mages, who thought their words had been heard, stared at the woman in the purple robe with wide eyes.<br><br>“Wow, the princess?”<br><br>“Princess Jayna….”<br><br>The noisy interior of the teahouse fell silent as if it had turned into a library at the sight of Jayna.<br><br>“If you're so curious, I'll tell you.”<br><br>The man in the red robe sitting across from Jayna flicked his fingers.<br><br>“I'm the one who went there.”<br><br>When he removed the hood covering his face, the sharp features of Morell Kazan, a middle-aged man, were revealed.<br><br>“No, surely not...”<br><br>“Morell Kazan?”<br><br>The magicians in the teahouse looked back and forth between Jayna and Morell Kazan, breathing heavily.<br><br>“Um, well...”<br><br>“Why are Morell and Jayna here...”<br><br>The magicians couldn't finish their sentences and shivered.<br><br>“I returned early to report on behalf of Chamber. I was just about to have some tea and go to the royal palace, but this is quite a sight.”<br><br>The young magicians swallowed hard and stepped back under Morell Kazan's cold gaze.<br><br>“Did you ask if I saw it myself? Yes. I saw Raon Ziggart cut off the Black Tower Lord’s head with my own eyes. Without Chamber, we couldn’t have captured the Black Tower Lord? That’s right. But without Raon, Chamber wouldn’t have been able to kill the Black Tower Lord either.”<br><br>He frowned, saying that Raon was the main protagonist of this war.<br><br>“I climbed the Black Tower with him. I saw with my own eyes as we killed countless demons and demonic beings, including the Black King and Masungro, and finally beheaded the Black Tower Lord.”<br><br>Jina nodded as she recalled the memory of chasing after Raon and climbing the Black Tower.<br><br>"I understand that you all want to hold Chamber in higher regard. You might feel like Raon has taken away her achievements and fame. But there’s no need to think that way. He is different from us.”<br><br>She felt strangely relieved as she defended Raon, whom she had once hated so much. It seemed that gratitude and affection had replaced her hatred.<br><br>“That’s right. Raon Zieghart is different."<br><br>Morell Kazan waved his hand, saying that Raon was someone who should be sent to a higher place.<br><br>“He is different...”<br><br>The young magicians seemed shocked by Morell and Jeana's words and swallowed hard.<br><br>“The proof of that is the new title that Raon Zieghart has earned. A title that only one person can earn, without any qualifiers.”<br><br>Morell Kazan looked at everyone in the teahouse and pursed his lips.<br><br>“Sword Master.”<br><br>He shuddered as if he had just spoken the words.<br><br>“Sword Emperor Raon Zieghart. It's a name that suits a swordsman who overthrew the king and ascended to the throne himself.”<br><br>***<br><br>“Sword Emperor Raon Zieghart.”<br><br>Chamber smiled and added the title “Sword Emperor” to his name.<br><br>“Sword Emperor...?”<br><br>Raon's eyes widened as he heard Chamber's words.<br><br>“Me, a Sword Emperor?”<br><br>He hadn't even considered the possibility that his nickname might have changed, but he never imagined that it would be Sword Emperor.<br><br>“Originally, they were going to call you Sword King because of your age, but your previous nickname was Usurper. They thought it wouldn't be appropriate to call someone who overthrew the king Sword King, so they changed it to Sword Emperor.”<br><br>Chamber smiled slightly, saying it wasn’t bad.<br><br>“Come to think of it, it doesn’t really fit. How many kings have you overthrown? You defeated your father in a life-or-death battle, beheaded the king who was devoured by demons in Schper, and killed the Black King here.”<br><br>“Hmm…”<br><br>“Even the Black Tower Lord, who wields the Black King, fell into your hands, so it’s only natural that you should become the Sword Emperor.”<br><br>She nodded, saying that she didn’t know who he was, but that he had been given a proper name.<br><br>“Hmm, it’s a little burdensome…”<br><br>Raon lowered his eyes. He didn’t know about anything else, but he found it too burdensome to have the title of emperor attached to the name of the sword.<br><br>“There are some strange people who come up with their own nicknames, but most nicknames are given by the public. They depend on the person’s achievements.”<br><br>Chamber clicked her lips and put a lollipop in her mouth.<br><br>“Among them, there are nicknames of the highest rank. Like Sword Emperor, Former King, and Conqueror, Sword Emperor is a name that only the highest-ranking warrior can receive.”<br><br>She raised her finger upward, implying that he had been recognized by everyone.<br><br>“In your grandfather's case, he was called the Northern Conqueror and the Northern Overlord because of his achievements in the north, but in the end, he is known by only one name now.”<br><br>Chamber stared intently at Raon and parted her lips.<br><br>“Sword God. The being standing at the highest point on this continent. No one but the Heavenly Demon can reach it.”<br><br>She laughed, saying that the name alone sent chills down her spine.<br><br>“Then I'm also because of my grandfather's name...”<br><br>“No, it has nothing to do with that man. You received that name because of your own achievements and future.”<br><br>Chamber raised her small hand and placed it on her left chest.<br><br>“You earned that name by beheading the Black Tower Lord, so cherish it and never lose it.”<br><br>She nodded, urging him to continue to live up to the name of Sword Emperor.<br><br>“Hmm…”<br><br>Raon scratched the back of his head.<br><br>Runaan raised his thumb as if to say it was good.<br><br>“Runaan's new nickname is Full Moon Fairy. They say she's a moon fairy who saves people.”<br><br>Burren smiled as he explained Runaan's new nickname. It seemed like a nickname she had earned for always moving in the direction of saving others.<br><br>“What about you?”<br><br>Raon looked at Martha. She had also become a Grand Master, so her nickname must have changed.<br><br>“Ugh...”<br><br>Martha didn't answer right away, but gritted her teeth with her shoulders hunched.<br><br>“Hm?”<br><br>“Rakscha...”<br><br>“Huh? Rakscha? What kind of nickname is that...”<br><br>“It's still Rakshasa! Damn it! Why am I still Rakshasa? I'm a Grand Master now, so change it!”<br><br>She couldn't understand and bit the iron plate covered with bandages.<br><br>“Well, the only nickname that can describe her fighting style is Rakshasa...”<br><br>Burren lowered his eyes slightly, saying that the nickname would remain the same.<br><br>“Miss Rakshasa for life.”<br><br>Runaan smiled faintly, as if pleased that Martha’s nickname would remain the same.<br><br>“Shut up! You bitch! Because of you, I’m not Sword of Rakshasa, I became Miss Rakshasa!”<br><br>Martha screamed and rushed forward, and Runaan stuck out her tongue and ran away.<br><br>“Haa...”<br><br>Raon shook his head as he watched Runaan and Martha run out of the hospital room.<br><br>“I'm sorry. She's still young...”<br><br>“No, she's old enough.”<br><br>Chamber smiled faintly, as if she had been the same.<br><br>“Ah, and…”<br><br>She lowered her hand and grabbed Lencia’s shoulder.<br><br>“This girl you saved. Can I take her with me?”<br><br>Chamber nodded cautiously, as if to ask if it was okay.<br><br>“What do you mean by ‘take her with me’?”<br><br>“Lencia seems to have a lot of talent for magic. It might be because she became the core of the barrier I created, ‘The Lamp That Awakes the Darkness,’ but she seemed to have considerable talent even before that.”<br><br>She licked her lips, sensing that Lencia had talent similar to her own.<br><br>“Really?”<br><br>“Yes. It's a little late, but unlike warriors, magicians don't have to start from childhood.”<br><br>Chamber nodded, saying that Lencia would become an outstanding magician.<br><br>“But why are you telling me this?”<br><br>Raon tilted his head, looking at Chamber and Lencia.<br><br>“You’re the one who saved the child, and this guy needs your permission first.”<br><br>Chamber patted Rensia’s head, saying she had a good personality unlike others.<br><br>They were similar in height, so it looked like she was patting a friend.<br><br>“Hmm, I see.”<br><br>Raon smiled faintly at Chamber.<br><br>‘he’s different, as usual.’<br><br>No one would dare object if Chamber just took her away.<br><br>But she had considered his and Lencia’s wishes first. As always, she was someone who didn’t think about status.<br><br>“Lencia. What about you?”<br><br>Raon nodded slightly to Lencia as they made eye contact.<br><br>“Hmm, I…”<br><br>Lencia lowered her eyes slightly and licked her lips.<br><br>“I hope my siblings are happy.”<br><br>Even in a situation where her own choice was at stake, she thought of her siblings first.<br><br>“Don’t worry about that. Since your role was so important this time, I plan to repay you more than that. In terms of money, it would be enough for you and your siblings to live comfortably for the rest of your lives.”<br><br>“Ah…”<br><br>“So now, choose what you want.”<br><br>Raon told her for the first time to choose what she wanted for herself.<br><br>“I…”<br><br>Lencia slowly turned her eyes to Chamber.<br><br>“I want to learn magic!”<br><br>She wanted to follow him, but she bit her lip, saying she wanted to learn magic to become stronger.<br><br>“Then it’s decided.”<br><br>Raon took his hand off Lencia’s shoulder.<br><br>“Take good care of her.”<br><br>“Yes. I’ll take better care of her than my own wounds.”<br><br>Chamber smiled reassuringly, as if to say not to worry.<br><br>“You don’t have to go that far.”<br><br>Raon shook his head and laughed hollowly.<br><br>“Thank you. Thank you so much, Raon-nim.”<br><br>Lencia smiled and shed tears. These were not the fake smiles she had shown while working as a guide, but tears and smiles that flowed from her heart.<br><br>Perhaps she had fought until the end because she wanted to see that smile, that laughter, ever since she learned of that child's circumstances.<br><br>“You know pain, so you can become a better magician than anyone else.”<br><br>Raon smiled as he stroked Lencia's head.<br><br>Even after seeing the Black Tower collapse and the Black Tower Lord die, he didn't feel like he had won, but after seeing the child's smile, he finally felt that the war was over. All the strength drained from his body.<br><br>“It's not over yet!”<br><br>Wrath gritted his teeth and stood up.<br><br>“The king hasn't eaten yet!”<br><br>“It's all over. I should get some more sleep...”<br><br>“No, it's not!”<br><br>***<br><br>Three days later.<br><br>A small festival was held in Montiro to celebrate the victory over the Black Tower.<br><br>Thanks to the supplies gathered from across the continent, the festival was much larger and more splendid than the one originally held in Montiro.<br><br>“This is good.”<br><br>Raon nodded in satisfaction as he put a skewer of fresh leeks and chicken into his mouth.<br><br>“Hmm, it's not bad, but I prefer soy sauce to salt.”<br><br>Wrath waved his round hand, saying he liked the sauce to be thick.<br><br>“Should I eat more salted chicken skewers then?”<br><br>“No, I feel like trying something else this time. First...”<br><br>Just as he was about to choose the next food he wanted to eat,<br><br>whoosh!<br><br>Something grayish swept past the street vendor, and all the food there disappeared, leaving only a gold coin.<br><br>-No, it's that guy!<br><br>Wrath's jaw trembled.<br><br>-That food-eating guy is eating everything!<br><br>He yelled to hurry up and grab the food.<br><br>“I understand. I understand.”<br><br>Raon smiled and stood up.<br><br>“Then what do you want to eat?”<br><br>“The beef intestines cooking deliciously on the stove over there...”<br><br>As Wrath mentioned the beef intestines, there was a whoosh sound, and all the grilled intestines disappeared.<br><br>“It seems they've been taken.”<br><br>“Then, the wood-fired pizza over there...”<br><br>As soon as he mentioned the wood-fired pizza, two perfectly cooked pizzas vanished in an instant. The only thing left on the counter was, as usual, a single gold coin.<br><br>“Oh! The Gold Spirit has arrived!”<br><br>“Over here too! Please come over here too!”<br><br>“Our meat is the tastiest!”<br><br>Even though it was a festival and prices were high, paying a single gold coin was a luxury, so the merchants were happy even though the food disappeared in an instant.<br><br>“Huh…”<br><br>Raon awkwardly smiled and waved his hand.<br><br>“Gluttony must have been really hungry.”<br><br>“Ugh, let’s go straight to dessert before everything gets taken! Let’s have pearl ice cream!”<br><br>Wrath, seemingly seeking revenge on Gluttony, gave up on the food and pulled Raon’s hand, urging him to eat dessert right away.<br><br>“Right. There should be ice cream.”<br><br>Raon nodded and headed toward the bead ice cream shop.<br><br>But it seemed too late; only the shopkeeper remained, cleaning the floor.<br><br>“Are you closing already?”<br><br>He approached the shopkeeper, who was about to close the door, and asked.<br><br>“Ah, before the festival started, a little girl came and said she wanted to buy all the ice cream. I thought she’d give up halfway through eating it, so I agreed, but she really ate it all and left.”<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>The manager couldn’t believe what he had seen and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.<br><br>-That, that bastard…<br><br>Wrath grabbed his head and shook it.<br><br>-That gluttonous bastard! She ate all the ice cream first and then went somewhere else!<br><br>He shook his head, certain that it was Gluttony’s doing.<br><br>“We've been had! We've become too accustomed to the human world's habit of eating a meal and then dessert!”<br><br>Wratha gritted his teeth in anger.<br><br>“Right now! Summon the king immediately! I won't feel better until that gluttonous creature is dead!”<br><br>He shook his fists up and down, unable to contain himself any longer.<br><br>He had planned to buy everything he wanted to eat today, but he was caught off guard by this unexpected turn of events.<br><br>“Just bear with it for now.”<br><br>Raon was about to move to buy something else to eat when Karoon approached him.<br><br>“Your body seems to have fully recovered.”<br><br>Karoon, who also appeared to have fully recovered, wore his usual well-pressed uniform and lowered his eyes.<br><br>“Yes, thanks to you.”<br><br>Raon smiled faintly and nodded. In this war, Karoon had taken charge of the lower battles, allowing him to focus on the fight against the Black Tower Lord without worry.<br><br>Though it was their first time fighting together, it felt as though they had been in sync for years.<br><br>“Now I know what kind of warrior you are.”<br><br>Karoon nodded as he looked into Raon’s eyes, which were the same color as his own.<br><br>“In the war against the Black Tower, you were the one who best lived up to the name of Zieghart. You’ve worked hard.”<br><br>He turned away after saying those words, which seemed to be his first acknowledgment of Raon.<br><br>“Then.”<br><br>Karoon seemed to have only wanted to say those words, and without hesitation, he disappeared into the crowd of the festival.<br><br>“……”<br><br>Raon smiled slightly as he watched Karoon’s back, now free of his burdens.<br><br>‘Some people do change.’<br><br>Some say that people never change, but in his eyes, there were those who changed and those who did not.<br><br>‘I need to change more too.’<br><br>“What do you mean, change? You’ve been a crazy bastard since I first met you!”<br><br>Wrath shook his head, saying he had never changed.<br><br>“That’s not it. Strength. I need to get stronger.”<br><br>Next time, he wanted to face the leader of the Five Emperors and Five Demons with his own strength.<br><br>It was still a long way off, but someday it would definitely be possible.<br><br>-Hmph. You're still far from it!<br><br>“I know. But seeing this might bring me a little closer.”<br><br>-What are you looking at? Even if you look a thousand times... Huh?<br><br>Raon ignored Wrath' rambling and called up the message window.<br><br>-Wait, just a moment... Kuch!<br><br>A large number of message windows popped up simultaneously, and Wrath, who had been standing in front of him, was knocked back as if hit by a carriage.<br><br>“Hm?”<br><br>Raon didn't even bother to look at Wrath, who had flown away, and stared intently at the end of the message.<br><br>“This is here too?”</p>
