        <p>'I've seen Krakens a few times before, but...'<br><br>Raon exhaled heavily as he observed the Kraken hidden beneath the brown sand.<br><br>'I've never seen one this big before.'<br><br>He had seen Krakens before - when he was on Alice's ship hunting Kaivar, and during his stay in Montiro to destroy the Black Tower. Those Krakens had been massive enough to easily destroy sailing ships, but they were still at the level of monsters.<br><br>'But this one is different.'<br><br>The Kraken before his eyes was of such extraordinary size that it could carry an entire city on its back.<br><br>'And it possesses bloody energy too.'<br><br>The Kraken wasn't just terrifying for its immense strength and speed from that massive body; it also concealed a chillingly dark bloody energy. Even he would find it difficult to face this creature underwater.<br><br>-Furthermore, it's using concealment techniques.<br><br>Wrath frowned, noting that even with Grandmaster-level aura perception, it would be difficult to locate the hidden Kraken.<br><br>'That's not concealment magic, it's an octopus's natural ability.'<br><br>Raon shook his head while looking at the brown sand.<br><br>-Huh? An octopus's ability?<br><br>'Octopuses have special pigments and muscles that allow them to change their skin color and texture to match their surroundings.'<br><br>The Kraken's ability to camouflage itself to match the sand's color wasn't magical power, but rather an innate ability of Octopuses.<br><br>-Though of course, this one is harder to find than a normal octopus.<br><br>The fact that it required the Azure Clear Eye to see it suggested it was using ocean mana and magic to erase even the slightest traces of its presence.<br><br>[That's a Kraken...?]<br><br>Roenn swallowed hard, seemingly shocked by the Kraken's unimaginable size.<br><br>[Is that really a Kraken? I've never seen one this huge before.]<br><br>Evelyn, despite having seen many Krakens before, blinked in confusion, saying she'd never encountered one of this size.<br><br>[Whether it was grown through magic or naturally born this way, we shouldn't think of it as a normal Kraken.]<br><br>This creature wasn't like the monster Krakens they knew - it was more like the true monsters from myths and legends.<br><br>[And that makes sense.]<br><br>This explained everything - why there were no marine monsters or fish from where the turtle rock disappeared, and why the White Blood Religion headquarters was located beneath this undersea valley where it shouldn't be - it was all because of this monster's presence.<br><br>[This won't be easy.]<br><br>Roenn bit his lip as he watched the sand shifting slightly with the Kraken's breathing.<br><br>[I'm not confident I can dodge its tentacles.]<br><br>He let out a low groan, noting that using aura to dodge the tentacles would reveal their position to the White Blood Religion.<br><br>[Same here.]<br><br>Evelyn let out a short sigh while gripping her diving suit with her fingers.<br><br>[Even with magic, it's impossible to break through that magical barrier without leaving traces.]<br><br>She lowered her eyebrows, saying the magical formations were too densely interconnected to analyze easily. A low growl escaped as the Sea Spirit's fur trembled all over, seemingly afraid of the Kraken. No, looking at its gaze, it appeared more afraid of the Leader of the White Blood Religion inside the headquarters than the Kraken.<br><br>[Let's retreat for now.]<br><br>Raon turned his head while patting the Sea Spirit's back.<br><br>[Already?]<br><br>Evelyn's eyes widened in surprise. She seemed to want to stay and examine the magic formations more.<br><br>[If they're guarding this thoroughly, they might notice our presence from the fish we threw earlier. We've gathered important information, so retreating now is the right move.]<br><br>Though he wanted to investigate the surroundings more, it was better to withdraw and observe the situation since they couldn't predict how the White Blood Religion would react.<br><br>[I agree.]<br><br>Roenn raised his hand in agreement.<br><br>[I'll take the lead again.]<br><br>He turned around and headed back the way they came, suggesting they move immediately.<br><br>[Let's go too.]<br><br>Raon held onto Evelyn and followed Roenn up the ocean valley.<br><br>[Can't we come here every day?]<br><br>Evelyn's violet eyes turned toward him.<br><br>[I love feeling your warmth like this.]<br><br>She exhaled excitedly, saying she wanted to stay close like this all the time.<br><br>[This is the last time.]<br><br>Raon gently pushed Evelyn away, saying he wouldn't support her next time. The Sea Spirit, having left the valley, seemed to stop trembling and exhaled softly while resting its legs on his shoulder.<br><br>[Good work.]<br><br>Raon smiled faintly while patting the Sea Spirit's head. Having already decided to retreat, they quickly moved and returned to the beach near the harbor.<br><br>"Phew."<br><br>Raon swept back his wet hair while removing his diving suit.<br><br>"Is it dawn already?"<br><br>Perhaps due to the tension from encountering the White Blood Religion headquarters and the Kraken, more time had passed than they'd realized.<br><br>"Ugh..."<br><br>Evelyn sank down onto the sandy beach, squeezing her eyes shut.<br><br>"I didn't expect it to be hidden so deep. This won't be easy, will it?"<br><br>She wrinkled her nose, saying it looked difficult to penetrate.<br><br>"Yes. No matter how we attack, we're bound to be detected."<br><br>Roenn nodded while shaking out his diving suit.<br><br>"Assassination is impossible without inside information."<br><br>He scratched his forehead, saying they'd be discovered before even entering the headquarters.<br><br>"Let's call it a day for now."<br><br>Raon briefly clicked his tongue and set the Sea Spirit, still clinging to his shoulder, down on the sand.<br><br>-Hmm...<br><br>Wrath stroked his chin and let out a deep sigh.<br><br>'Why are you worried too...'<br><br>-That thing looks quite delicious. It would be good grilled or boiled.<br><br>He was already salivating at the thought of eating the Kraken.<br><br>"Haa..."<br><br>Raon let out a deep sigh and approached the Sea Spirit.<br><br>"You must have been scared, thank you for coming with us."<br><br>He patted the Sea Spirit's head while expressing his gratitude.<br><br>"Kyaang!"<br><br>The Sea Spirit licked his hand as if to say it was fine. It felt like cool seawater touching his fingertips.<br><br>"Wait!"<br><br>Evelyn suddenly raised her hand while looking at him.<br><br>"What's that child's name?"<br><br>She asked while picking up the Sea Spirit that was shaking off water.<br><br>"Name? I don't know either."<br><br>He had only called it Sea Spirit, so he didn't know its name.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>Evelyn's jaw dropped in disbelief.<br><br>"You've been treating it so roughly and you don't even know its name?"<br><br>"Huh, roughly? When did I ever treat it roughly...?"<br><br>"It is rough treatment! The poor thing was trembling but still guided us to such a dangerous place, and you don't even know its name..."<br><br>She glared at him as if wondering how he could be so thoughtless.<br><br>"Well, I didn't have time to learn its name, and it's not even a spirit contracted to me..."<br><br>"Contract? Do you have no affection at all? This is too much!"<br><br>Evelyn hugged the wide-eyed Sea Spirit tightly, expressing her disappointment.<br><br>"No, I mean..."<br><br>-Now that I hear it, you have been quite harsh.<br><br>This time Wrath interrupted his words.<br><br>-This time, I agree with the mad woman.<br><br>He muttered that it was his fault too for not thinking about it until now.<br><br>"Hahaha!"<br><br>Roenn burst into laughter while organizing his diving suit.<br><br>"Everyone else is in Master Raon's palm, but Lady Evelyn is quite the opposite."<br><br>He nodded emphatically, saying it was an interesting relationship.<br><br>"That's right. It's a special relationship!"<br><br>Evelyn smiled brightly, murmuring in agreement.<br><br>"Not at all."<br><br>Raon firmly shook his head and looked at the Sea Spirit in Evelyn's arms.<br><br>"Do you have a name?"<br><br>"Kyarung?"<br><br>The Sea Spirit shook its head as if to say it had no name.<br><br>"Then..."<br><br>Raon nodded as he looked at the spirit whose mane changed color with the sea.<br><br>"How about Haerang? It means 'wolf of the sea.'"<br><br>"Kyaooooo!"<br><br>The Sea Spirit let out an adorable howl like a real wolf looking up at the sky, clearly pleased with the name. The sea spirit howled three times in succession, and a blue light emanated from its body as its cotton-like fur grew longer. Now it looked less like a wolf and more like a fluffy puppy.<br><br>Though its appearance hadn't changed much, the ocean energy emanating from within Haerang had intensified remarkably. It felt like a shallow sea had become a deep ocean.<br><br>"What's this?"<br><br>Raon let out a confused breath as he watched the happily crying Haerang.<br><br>'It changed this much just from receiving a name?'<br><br>It was surprising that it had grown this much just from receiving a name, without even forming a contract.<br><br>"It seems this is no ordinary spirit."<br><br>Evelyn narrowed her eyes while stroking Haerang's now softer fur.<br><br>"Well, someone like the Leader of the White Blood Religion wouldn't use an ordinary spirit."<br><br>She nodded, saying that just the fact it could withstand the Leader's bloody energy proved it wasn't ordinary.<br><br>"Haerang. We'll be back tonight, so I'm counting on you again."<br><br>Raon told Haerang to rest as he set it down in the sea.<br><br>"Kaooo!"<br><br>Haerang narrowed its eyes and nodded, seeming happy about having a name.<br><br>"You're going again tonight?"<br><br>Roenn's eyes widened as if wondering if that was wise.<br><br>"Yes. We need to investigate thoroughly. Even a slightly better chance of defeating the White Blood Religion is worth it."<br><br>Raon raised his hand as if to say it was obvious.<br><br>"You're right."<br><br>Though Roenn shared the same thought, he could only manage a gentle smile, unable to speak hastily.<br><br>"I also have a lot to check regarding the magical formations. However..."<br><br>Evelyn licked her lips, saying she wanted to analyze the magical formations protecting the White Blood Religion.<br><br>"How about going in two days instead of tonight?"<br><br>"Two days? I don't mind, but why?"<br><br>Raon tilted his head, asking for the reason.<br><br>"This..."<br><br>Evelyn raised her finger to point at the diving suit she was wearing.<br><br>"I want to make some improvements."<br><br>***<br><br>Knock knock.<br><br>While the 10th Apostle was working, a knock came from the office door.<br><br>"Come in."<br><br>When he gave permission to enter, a blonde woman wearing a white robe opened the door and came into the office.<br><br>"What is it?"<br><br>The 10th Apostle asked about her business without taking his eyes off the documents he was holding.<br><br>"Something was caught in the Kraken's barrier just now."<br><br>The blonde woman bowed her head as she reported the Kraken's movement.<br><br>"...An intruder?"<br><br>The 10th Apostle raised his eyes while crumpling the document.<br><br>"No. According to the guards, it was just a dead fish. It seems to have drifted in with the current."<br><br>The blonde woman shook her head, insisting it definitely wasn't an intruder.<br><br>"Normally we would have handled this ourselves, but since security has been heightened..."<br><br>She bowed again, apologizing for bothering him with something so trivial.<br><br>"Do fish normally come to this area?"<br><br>The 10th Apostle lowered his eyebrows while smoothing out the crumpled document.<br><br>"It happens occasionally with the currents, but it's very rare."<br><br>The blonde woman lowered her voice, saying it happened sometimes.<br><br>"..."<br><br>The 10th Apostle narrowed his eyes as he looked at the blonde woman.<br><br>"I was about to order increased security..."<br><br>"No."<br><br>He cut off the blonde woman's words as he stood up.<br><br>"I'll inspect it personally for the next few days."<br><br>The 10th Apostle headed toward the door, saying he would personally stand guard and observe the situation.<br><br>"What? There's no need to go that far..."<br><br>The blonde woman's eyes widened in surprise.<br><br>"No, this is the right thing to do."<br><br>The 10th Apostle shook his head firmly.<br><br>"With the 9th Apostle dead and the Blood Spirit Ship destroyed, Zieghart or the Five Kings might be making their move."<br><br>He opened the door and left, saying it was right for him to check personally.<br><br>'With her great work so close to completion...'<br><br>The 10th Apostle clenched his fist as he looked at the headquarters' sky covered in hazy mist.<br><br>'We can't let even a single rat slip through.'<br><br>He bit his lip deeply and headed toward the observation post where he could monitor the outside.<br><br>***<br><br>"Here!"<br><br>Before entering the sea, Evelyn held out a diving suit that shimmered with a deeper blue color.<br><br>"What's this?"<br><br>Raon blinked as he looked at the new diving suit Evelyn was handing him.<br><br>"I added invisibility magic to the diving suit."<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>He let out a surprised breath while examining the diving suit Evelyn had given him.<br><br>"Didn't you say before that the magic was too heavy to work?"<br><br>"I improved it."<br><br>"In such a short time?"<br><br>"I got a hint from the Kraken."<br><br>Evelyn smiled brightly, saying she used magic similar to how the Kraken changes its protective coloring.<br><br>"It's not perfect invisibility magic, but in the water it'll be even harder to detect."<br><br>She waggled her finger, saying that unless a Transcendent was looking directly at them, they wouldn't be easy to find.<br><br>"That's amazing."<br><br>"Of course it is! Magic is always about creating something from nothing."<br><br>Evelyn straightened her back and lifted her nose proudly, pleased with the praise.<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>"No need for thanks between us!"<br><br>She waved her hand, saying thanks weren't necessary.<br><br>"Then shall we depart?"<br><br>"Hahaha. Alright."<br><br>Roenn seemed pleased with the new diving suit, brushed his shoulder once, and entered the sea. When Raon and Evelyn followed him into the water, Haerang leaped up roughly like a marlin, as if it had been waiting for them. It seemed even more energetic after receiving its name and growing. <br><br>Haerang swished its tail as if offering to guide the way and moved forward through the sea.<br><br>"Let's go."<br><br>Raon smiled faintly as he followed Haerang back down to the valley where the White Blood Religion was located.<br><br>'This place feels unsettling every time we come here.'<br><br>The bloody energy dissolved in the water was so subtle that even a Grandmaster would have trouble detecting it, yet just touching the water felt unpleasant.<br><br>'Fortunately, nothing has moved.'<br><br>The Kraken and the White Blood Religion headquarters remained in place, seemingly unaware of their visit two days ago.<br><br>'Today we need to get closer and examine... Hm?'<br><br>Having been here before, he was about to move more leisurely but stopped, making a fist to signal Evelyn and Roenn to halt.<br><br>'I can feel someone watching.'<br><br>Though not directly looking at him, he could sense a highly skilled person scanning the area.<br><br>'Wrath. You felt it too?'<br><br>-Of course I did.<br><br>Wrath nodded as if wondering why Raon even needed to ask.<br><br>-Today it's not the octopus...<br><br>He raised his hand to point at the White Blood Religion headquarters.<br><br>-There's someone inside watching this area.<br><br>Wrath frowned, saying he was certain of it.<br><br>'This gaze wasn't here two days ago. Then...'<br><br>Raon frowned as he looked at the White Blood Religion headquarters.<br><br>'It means they noticed the fish entering their barrier.'<br><br>It seemed security had been strengthened after the fish they threw hit the barrier two days ago.<br><br>For their gaze to reach this far, they must be quite skilled. If Evelyn hadn't placed concealment magic on these diving suits, their position would have been discovered immediately.<br><br>'Security is tighter than expected. Whoever they are, someone cool-headed is in charge of defense.'<br><br>Given that they were strengthening security despite having magic, barriers, and a monster like the Kraken for protection, it was clear that a level-headed apostle was in charge of defense.<br><br>[What's wrong?]<br><br>[Someone is watching this area right now.]<br><br>Raon explained the situation to Roenn and Evelyn, saying they should observe the headquarters from a greater distance than yesterday.<br><br>[The Five Demons certainly live up to their name.]<br><br>Roenn let out a breath, impressed by their capabilities.<br><br>[It's fine as long as we haven't been completely discovered.]<br><br>Evelyn waved her hand, saying she could still see the magic formations from this distance.<br><br>'Fortunately...'<br><br>Raon nodded as he looked at the softly glowing White Blood Religion headquarters.<br><br>'We haven't been detected.'<br><br>If their identities had been discovered, the Leader of the White Blood Religion or an apostle would have rushed out immediately. The increased security and new surveillance showed they were only at the stage of suspicion.<br><br>'Then what I need to do is...'<br><br>Just gather information. Raon circled at the closest possible distance, thinking about how to break through the headquarters' defense system.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Roenn and Evelyn also observed the White Blood Religion headquarters and the Kraken hidden beneath it with serious expressions, each considering what they could do.<br><br>[Let's head back now.]<br><br>Sensing dawn approaching, Raon gestured to Roenn and Evelyn that they should leave.<br><br>[Okay!]<br><br>[Understood.]<br><br>The two of them nodded as if they had finished their observations and followed him out of the sea.<br><br>"Haa..."<br><br>Raon let out a heavy sigh while removing his diving suit.<br><br>"We gathered information, but I don't know what to do with it."<br><br>Returning to Zieghart and reporting the information wouldn't be difficult, but he still couldn't figure out how to attack the White Blood Religion headquarters. Though not in the deep sea, it was still far underwater, and breaking through this ancient fortress protected by magic and the Kraken seemed impossible.<br><br>"I feel the same..."<br><br>Roenn deeply furrowed his brows.<br><br>"No matter how much I think about it, I can't see a way."<br><br>He shook his head, saying that even entering, let alone assassination, would be difficult. As he clicked his tongue at the rare sight of Roenn's troubled expression, Evelyn and Haerang finally emerged from the sea.<br><br>"Thanks, Evelyn. If it weren't for you, we would have been discovered immediately."<br><br>He extended his hand, saying they were able to avoid detection from the White Blood Religion thanks to Evelyn's improvements to the diving suits.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Unlike her usual self, she didn't rush toward him but stood staring blankly at the sea.<br><br>"I think it might work?"<br><br>Evelyn nodded, suggesting something might be possible.<br><br>"What do you mean?"<br><br>Raon approached Evelyn with wide eyes.<br><br>"Attacking the White Blood Religion headquarters..."<br><br>Evelyn smiled as she raised her slender finger.<br><br>"I think it might be possible."<br><br>"Really? How?"<br><br>His eyes widened at something he hadn't even considered possible.<br><br>"As I said before..."<br><br>Evelyn smiled brightly while pointing at the diving suit she had given them today.<br><br>"Magic is the art of creating something from nothing."</p>
