        <p>Kuguuuu! The wolf emerged from the water, its sea-infused coat glistening.<br><br>Its massive body, large enough to touch the sun at the zenith, was as majestic as an island. The blue-tinged fur tips emanating natural mana made it seem not like a living being, but like facing the World Tree protecting Sepia.<br><br>"Th-that's it!"<br><br>Lawaine raised a trembling finger to point at the blue wolf blocking out the sun.<br><br>"That's the wolf I told you about!"<br><br>He revealed his murderous intent towards the wolf that destroyed the village, even as he was flustered by the sudden situation.<br><br>"Wh-what? How is it so big! I didn't hear it was large enough to block out the sky!"<br><br>Martha gulped nervously, overwhelmed by the wolf's imposing physique.<br><br>"Its size isn't everything. That energy is beyond what we can handle..."<br><br>Burren bit his lip deeply, sensing the wolf's immense mana.<br><br>"A cool and big doggy..."<br><br>Unlike the others, Runaan didn't fear the wolf, nodding her head with a calm gaze.<br><br>"Aaaaah!"<br><br>"M-monster! No, it's beyond that level!"<br><br>"That's not a monster, it's on par with a dragon!"<br><br>"O-one kick from it would destroy half this ship..."<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen and sailors all trembled in fear, unable to look directly at the blue wolf.<br><br>"That won't happen."<br><br>Raon said not to worry as he moved towards the bow of the Azure Wind.<br><br>'I didn't expect to meet like this so soon.'<br><br>He had been wondering how to search the vast sea for the wolf, but didn't expect to face it right after setting sail.<br><br>'Mr. Lawaine wasn't mistaken.'<br><br>It's definitely Transcendent-level. This massive wolf possessed an overwhelming presence and mana that could match or even surpass a Transcendent, just as Lawaine had described. It truly seemed to have inherited the power of this sea.<br><br>'I didn't expect things to turn out like this.'<br><br>He had intended to help Lawaine while giving the Light Wind Palace swordsmen practical experience against pirates, but didn't expect the opportunity for growth to come to him first.<br><br>-Hooh.<br><br>Wrath smacked his lips with interest.<br><br>-It looks quite cute. It would be perfect to tie up in front of this king's castle!<br><br>He licked his lips, wanting to capture and take that wolf. To say such things after seeing a mysterious wolf with power beyond a Transcendent, he truly was the Demon King for a reason.<br><br>'However...'<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he drew the Heavenly Drive from his waist.<br><br>'Is that thing really alive?'<br><br>All living beings contain mana. The blue wolf had mana surpassing a Transcendent, but something was different from others.<br><br>'It's like a spirit, but has a physical presence. It's like a monster, but has a spiritual power.'<br><br>That blue wolf couldn't be classified as a single species like a monster or spirit.<br><br>'Regardless of its identity...'<br><br>Why is it just standing there? After surfacing, the blue wolf just stared intently at this direction. No, at him, with its sea-colored eyes.<br><br>'Is it sizing me up?'<br><br>Seeing the sea breeze imbued with mana blowing from the blue wolf, it was clearly trying to probe his power.<br><br>'Hmm.'<br><br>Raon shook his head after examining the blue wolf as well.<br><br>'I can't tell by aura perception.'<br><br>He couldn't gauge how strong that blue wolf was just by the amount of mana. In the end, he'd have to face it directly.<br><br>"Guard the ship."<br><br>Raon instructed the Light Wind Palace swordsmen to protect the Azure Wind before descending to the sea.<br><br>"Too much thinking isn't animal-like. Let's clash physically."<br><br>As he was about to use footwork to leap across the sea while licking his lips, the blue wolf began to sink back into the sea as if it had lost interest in him. Its body dispersed into blue droplets as if its form had never existed in the first place.<br><br>"What is this!"<br><br>Raon frowned and rushed to where the wolf had been standing.<br><br>'It...'<br><br>He spread his aura perception using the Perception of the Snow Flower, but couldn't sense the mana of that massive wolf anywhere.<br><br>'Wrath!'<br><br>Raon immediately gestured to Wrath.<br><br>-This king can't sense it either.<br><br>Wrath shook his head, saying it really seemed to have disappeared.<br><br>-Didn't it come to greet you?<br><br>He muttered that he liked the wolf even more, calling it well-mannered.<br><br>'That can't be.'<br><br>Raon pushed Wrath away and wrinkled his nose.<br><br>'What is it thinking?'<br><br>Did it retreat after seeing me while trying to attack this port? Not knowing the blue wolf's identity, he couldn't guess what it was thinking, which was frustrating.<br><br>"Tsk."<br><br>Raon clicked his tongue and returned to the Azure Wind's deck across the sea.<br><br>"Has it disappeared, sir?"<br><br>Lawaine quickly looked around, seeming worried.<br><br>"Yes. It completely erased its presence."<br><br>Raon sighed briefly, saying he couldn't find it.<br><br>"When you first encountered that wolf, did it disappear like this too?"<br><br>Lawaine asked if he had experienced the same phenomenon, since he said the wolf had disappeared.<br><br>"No."<br><br>Lawaine shook his head firmly.<br><br>"It only showed its face to me briefly before running away across the sea."<br><br>He said it hadn't stayed visible for long like this time, nor had it disappeared into water droplets, his eyes twitching.<br><br>"I see."<br><br>Raon raised his hand to stroke his chin.<br><br>'Is it really assessing people?'<br><br>For what reason?<br><br>'Because we might interfere with its business?'<br><br>But it didn't seem to have much malice. No matter how much he thought about it, he couldn't figure out the blue wolf's intentions for appearing.<br><br>"What did you all think?"<br><br>Raon turned around and called out to the Light Wind Palace swordsmen.<br><br>"It felt like facing the forces of nature."<br><br>Burren groaned, saying he still couldn't get his bearings.<br><br>"I know we're no match, but..."<br><br>Martha straightened her back with a composed posture.<br><br>"I wanted to fight it."<br><br>She spoke with force in her voice, saying it would have been interesting.<br><br>"I-I couldn't read its mind well..."<br><br>Dorian slumped his shoulders, saying he couldn't tell what the wolf was thinking even using his Mind's Eye.<br><br>"I..."<br><br>Runaan slowly parted her lips.<br><br>"It looked troubled..."<br><br>She waved her hand, saying the wolf's condition didn't seem good.<br><br>"Why did it look troubled?"<br><br>"I just felt that way..."<br><br>Runaan blinked, saying she wasn't sure herself.<br><br>'Troubled, huh...'<br><br>As Raon licked his lips, Wrath approached from the side.<br><br>-This king...<br><br>Wrath looked at the sea with a solemn gaze. His expression suggested he had sensed something.<br><br>'What did you see?'<br><br>-It doesn't look tasty!<br><br>He shook his head, saying it had an unappetizing appearance for some reason.<br><br>'...'<br><br>-But we should still taste it... Hey! Where are you going!<br><br>Raon ignored Wrath who was licking his lips and approached Lawaine.<br><br>"Let's depart for now. We have a long way to go..."<br><br>***<br><br>"Haa..."<br><br>Raon let out a short sigh as he entered a tavern in the port city of Kurt to fill his stomach.<br><br>'It didn't show up again after all.'<br><br>He had inspected the ports and villages protected under the Pirate King's name with Lawaine, but fortunately none had been attacked. They had come all the way to Kurt, tucked away in a corner, in case the wolf might visit other villages or ports, but gained nothing.<br><br>'Should I consider this fortunate?'<br><br>It was fortunate that there were no deaths or destroyed cities, but he felt a bit frustrated that the wolf didn't appear.<br><br>"Let's eat first."<br><br>Burren said they were tired and should eat first, handing him a menu.<br><br>-What's with Four-Eyes?<br><br>Wrath nodded his head greatly, saying this was the first time Burren said something he liked.<br><br>-First, since we're by the sea, we should start with seafood...<br><br>"Order whatever you want. Focus on seafood."<br><br>Raon passed the menu to Martha sitting across from him.<br><br>-This king's words aren't finished yet! We start with seafood, but there's much more!<br><br>'They eat well, so they'll order properly.'<br><br>Though Runaan ate lightly, Burren and Martha didn't discriminate in food, so they were bound to order everything on the menu.<br><br>"Is there even a need to look at the menu?"<br><br>"Right, we can just order everything."<br><br>Martha and Burren shouted to bring all the food on the menu as if it were obvious.<br><br>'See?'<br><br>-Hmm, but there's a certain pleasure in ordering...<br><br>Wrath licked his lips regretfully.<br><br>'But...'<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes at Wrath.<br><br>'It truly was a village that could only be called ruins.'<br><br>The word annihilation was understandable too. On the way here, they had also visited the village Lawaine said was annihilated. As he said, the village was decayed and collapsed as if abandoned for decades.<br><br>-It couldn't have corroded like that with just seawater.<br><br>Wrath shook his head, saying it couldn't happen through normal phenomena.<br><br>-That wolf must have used some trick.<br><br>He bit his lip, calling it a beast that didn't know the value of human life.<br><br>'Blue wolf...'<br><br>As Raon narrowed his eyes, thinking of the blue wolf he encountered as soon as he entered the sea, some men who looked like fishermen sat down at the table behind them with drinks in hand.<br><br>"The tides are good these days, but I'm worried because of the bad things happening."<br><br>A bald fisherman frowned as he downed his beer.<br><br>"I know. These days fish pour out as soon as you cast a line, but it's scary to go out."<br><br>A middle-aged man with cactus-like beard sighed.<br><br>"By the way, have you heard that news?"<br><br>The bald fisherman leaned in slightly as if telling a secret.<br><br>"What news?"<br><br>"About Raon Zieghart. You clearly don't know."<br><br>He snorted as if the other should already know.<br><br>"I-I know too. Why wouldn't I know about the Sword Emperor who caught the Black Tower Master?"<br><br>The cactus-bearded middle-aged man shook his head as if not wanting to lose.<br><br>"Tsk tsk."<br><br>The bald fisherman clicked his tongue briefly.<br><br>"You don't know because you're just fishing inside here."<br><br>He shook his head as if it were pathetic.<br><br>"Why! What else happened!"<br><br>The cactus-bearded middle-aged man pounded the table with his glass, telling him to speak.<br><br>"Ahem, it's a bit hard to say right away since I'm hungry and thirsty..."<br><br>The bald fisherman smacked his lips.<br><br>"Bartender! Bring two beers for this baldy!"<br><br>"I'll buy the snacks!"<br><br>"You like freebies, huh. No wonder you're bald."<br><br>The patrons in the tavern ordered drinks and snacks, saying they were even more curious, and gathered around the bald fisherman.<br><br>"Now that I've wet my throat, I should start right away!"<br><br>The bald fisherman slammed the table with his palm after putting down his glass.<br><br>"First, we should start with Eden. Eden cast a heavenly net to track down the traitor. Literally not even a mouse could escape..."<br><br>He detailed the events that took place to rescue Merlin. The rumors seemed to be spreading even more in detail than before.<br><br>"D-did Raon Zieghart really kill The Fallen?"<br><br>The cactus-bearded middle-aged man's eyes widened.<br><br>"That's what I'm saying!"<br><br>The bald fisherman nodded, saying the other had lived a sheltered life.<br><br>"Of course, the Mage Tower Master dealt with most of The Fallen's martial prowess, but it was definitely the Sword Emperor who finished him off!"<br><br>He shouted that Raon was the one who struck down The Fallen at the end as he downed his beer.<br><br>"A-amazing."<br><br>"To think a martial artist whose blood has barely dried would kill a monster like The Fallen..."<br><br>"Now that one of Eden's pillars has fallen, will things get easier for us too?"<br><br>The people in the tavern muttered that the Five Demons would have to lay low now as they started returning to their seats.<br><br>"Hey! Where are you going!"<br><br>The bald fisherman urgently raised his hands.<br><br>"I'm not done talking yet!"<br><br>He shook his head vigorously, saying he hadn't told everything.<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>"There's more?"<br><br>"What else is there after killing The Fallen?"<br><br>The people's eyes widened round, as if they hadn't expected there to be more to say.<br><br>"That's what I'm saying. The Fallen's death is already an old, tasteless rumor that's spread everywhere. What I really want to talk about is the next story."<br><br>The bald fisherman spread his arms as he chewed on a whole fish that was served as a side dish.<br><br>"After catching The Fallen, Raon Zieghart went straight to the Five Divine Orders without even resting for a few days. And there..."<br><br>He explained in detail, as if he had seen it himself, how Raon awakened the Thespian Emperor and the Queen of Swords, and received the alliance of White Whale and The Unyielding Blade.<br><br>"N-no matter how Raon Zieghart has the title of Sword Emperor, he awakened the Thespian Emperor and the Queen of Swords?"<br><br>"That doesn't make sense! There's hardly any difference in skill!"<br><br>"I'd believe it if you said he won in a fight, but awakening them is unbelievable."<br><br>The cactus-bearded middle-aged man and the residents shook their heads, saying it was hard to believe.<br><br>"I understand it's hard to believe, but this is an undeniable fact. Because..."<br><br>The bald fisherman raised a finger with a smirk.<br><br>"All these rumors came from White Whale."<br><br>He twisted his lips upwards, saying it came from none other than the Thespian Emperor's White Whale.<br><br>"I-is that true?"<br><br>The cactus-bearded middle-aged man shook his head in disbelief.<br><br>"That's what I'm saying. Why would White Whale underestimate their own master, the Thespian Emperor? It means it's all true!"<br><br>The bald fisherman waved his fist, saying this rumor was spreading across the entire continent right now.<br><br>"How does it feel?"<br><br>Martha asked as she tapped the table with her finger.<br><br>"When your name spreads across the entire continent like that?"<br><br>She licked her lips, saying she was curious about the feeling.<br><br>"I'm curious too."<br><br>Burren unfolded his arms, saying he had the same thought.<br><br>"We sometimes get included in your rumors, but we've never been the main character."<br><br>He asked how it felt to be the protagonist of the continent, his eyes sparkling.<br><br>"Well, it feels pretty good, but also..."<br><br>Raon smiled faintly as he watched people talking excitedly about his name and title.<br><br>"Quite embarrassing."<br><br>"Our Palace Master is such a shy person!"<br><br>Martha patted his shoulder strongly, saying he should have more confidence.<br><br>"What's there to be embarrassed about when you're so capable!"<br><br>She frowned, saying the rumors were lacking if anything.<br><br>"Yes. You're great at everything..."<br><br>Runaan nodded in agreement with Martha's words.<br><br>"Thanks for saying that."<br><br>Raon waved his hand with an awkward smile.<br><br>'White Whale is spreading rumors?'<br><br>I can guess what the Thespian Emperor is thinking. She was deliberately spreading detailed rumors to raise her awareness and reputation. She would clearly use that accumulated awareness and reputation to carry out other plans.<br><br>-Why! Why isn't this king's name mentioned!<br><br>Wrath frowned, saying it was all thanks to his abilities.<br><br>-All those feats were accomplished through this king's traits, so why is it that only your name is being praised!<br><br>He seemed upset that his name wasn't mentioned even once despite lending his abilities.<br><br>'What name? Let's just eat.'<br><br>Eating is what matters. Raon pointed at the dishes being served on the table as he tried to soothe Wrath who was about to vent his anger.<br><br>-Ahem, shall we?<br><br>Wrath grinned as if he had never been angry and looked at the dishes.<br><br>'What should we eat first?'<br><br>-This king will start with the freshly cooked shrimp, head and all...<br><br>As he was about to reach for the salt-grilled shrimp, the tavern door burst open with a bang and Lawaine entered.<br><br>"Lord Raon! Belder Harbor has been attacked!"<br><br>He raised his hand, saying it was information he just received.<br><br>"R-Raon?"<br><br>"C-could it be Raon Zieghart?"<br><br>"No way..."<br><br>"No! It is! That man is Lawaine, the Pirate King's... no, Alice's right arm!"<br><br>The people in the tavern sank to the floor in shock, realizing that the Raon they had been talking about was in the same place.<br><br>"Are you ready to set sail?"<br><br>Raon approached Lawaine, disregarding the people's gazes.<br><br>"Yes! We can leave right away!"<br><br>Lawaine nodded, saying all preparations were complete.<br><br>"Then let's depart."<br><br>Raon paid for the uneaten food and left the tavern. The Light Wind Palace executives followed behind Raon with disciplined and spirited postures, as if they had never relaxed in the first place.<br><br>"I-is that Raon Zieghart?"<br><br>"I didn't even know he was here, but now that he's revealed his presence, I can barely breathe..."<br><br>"It seems even the title of Sword Emperor can't keep up with him now..."<br><br>The people shook their heads in amazement at seeing the Sword Emperor Raon in person. However, unlike the excited people, there was a Demon King holding back tears and biting his lip.<br><br>-This king knew this would happen...<br><br>Wrath bulged the veins in his neck as he looked at the numerous steaming dishes.<br><br>-Why do such unfortunate things only happen to this king! Even dogs aren't bothered when eating!<br><br>'Dogs bite if you bother them.'<br><br>-This crazy... This king also has teeth...<br><br>'Sorry, but we need to hurry.'<br><br>Raon shook his head as he pulled Wrath's tail.<br><br>'We don't need any more sacrifices.'</p>
