        <h3 class="my-5">Chapter 147</h3>
        <p>Facing their gazes, Raon clenched his fist. Their clear, unwavering eyes told him that they were serious about following him.<br><br>‘I’m speechless.’<br><br>There was no way he could tell them, ‘Actually, I’m the one that scammed the demon king’ when faced with those eyes.<br><br>Why is that frivolous snout of yours tightly shut right now? Tell them the truth! That you bamboozled the demon king!<br><br>Wrath pounded on Raon’s shoulder, urging him to tell the truth.<br><br>He wasn’t wrong. Raon wanted to reveal the truth to a certain extent, because of how they were acting towards him.<br><br>“Actually, I…”<br><br>“I told you, you don’t need to say anything.”<br><br>When Raon slowly opened his mouth, Terian raised his hand.<br><br>“What?”<br><br>“It’s well known that mentioning the contents of a trade with a demon makes the trade even more disadvantageous for you. You shouldn’t tell us anything, since we all know what happened.”<br><br>Terian smiled gently, telling him that he already understood everything.<br><br>Argh, I’m going insane. Why are you acting up when you don’t even know anything?<br><br>Wrath went to Terian and started pecking his head like a woodpecker.<br><br>There is no such thing as being at a disadvantage from mentioning the contents! And he is actually the one that benefited from the trade!<br><br>He kept thrashing his chest in frustration.<br><br>“No, what I’m trying to say is…”<br><br>“You don’t need to say anything.”<br><br>The captain of the Wolf Mercenary Corps, Beto, smiled. He had his fingers locked together, hands behind his head.<br><br>“We decided to stand behind you regardless of what happened that day. You don’t need to say anything.”<br><br>All of them must have a hole in their brains. I’m sure their reasoning abilities are all in the negative!<br><br>Wrath started foaming at the mouth. It looked like he was going to faint again.<br><br>“But you aren’t from Habun Castle, are you?”<br><br>Raon tilted his head slightly, looking at Beto. He was curious about why a mercenary corps captain, who was supposed to follow the money, was agreeing with them.<br><br>“Even the mercenaries know how valuable our lives are. That’s why we want to repay our debts properly.”<br><br>Beto stroked the Wolf nameplate, which had a wolf carved on it.<br><br>“It’s not just me. The mercenaries have also agreed. We can’t follow you everywhere, but we will risk our lives for you any time.”<br><br>The playful gleam disappeared from his eyes. Beto was also serious about wanting to support him.<br><br>“It’s not just the mercenaries. The swordsmen divisions, knight orders, and the soldiers—everyone agreed to stand behind you. That was the reason we announced your name.”<br><br>Milland looked around at the officers, one after the other, as he smiled.<br><br>‘So, that was why.’<br><br>Raon finally realized why people were looking at him differently on his way to the conference room. They were being more careful, since they’d all decided to follow him.<br><br>“I’m not such an amazing person. I’m not even from the direct line of Zieghart…”<br><br>“We are already aware of that fact. You aren’t a member of the direct line, but the strong blood of the Destructive King of the North is flowing through your veins.”<br><br>Milland shook his hand, telling him it didn’t matter. The expressions of the people standing next to him didn’t change either.<br><br>“Are you of the same mind?”<br><br>Raon looked at the Snow Strikers leader Edquill, who was standing on his right.<br><br>“Of course. I’ll follow you no matter what you do, no matter where you are.”<br><br>Edquill knelt to one knee and punched the ground.<br><br>“It was thanks to Sir Raon that I realized what’s more important than life. Please allow me to follow you!”<br><br>He wasn’t only saying that he wanted to support him or help him, but he was literally saying that he would follow him.<br><br>“Actually, he was the first one.”<br><br>Milland stepped up and grabbed Edquill’s shoulder.<br><br>“He said that he would follow you and asked me to expel him from Habun Castle.”<br><br>He lowered his eyebrows at the memory of that absurd statement.<br><br>“Hmm…”<br><br>Raon looked into Edquill’s eyes once again. He was even more serious than Milland and the other officers. He was for real.<br><br>Did he just say that annoying guy was the first one to say he wanted to follow you? Haah… I don’t even know anymore. Screw this.<br><br>Wrath started giggling, saying that he gave up. It looked like he had finally lost his mind.<br><br>“We also made sure the story about your trade with a demon wouldn’t spread. No one else will know, so don’t worry about it.”<br><br>Radin confidently knocked his chest. It looked like he used the scouts to stop the rumor from spreading.<br><br>“Haa…”<br><br>Raon caught his breath and straightened his back. Everyone’s thoughts and feelings touched his heart—it felt fuzzy.<br><br>“Thank you.”<br><br>Since it came down to that, he had no other choice but to accept it. Raon bowed at the people that were looking at him with trust.<br><br>“I’m looking forward to your help.”<br><br>“Whether you desire to become Zieghart’s head of house, or want to live as an average swordsman, we still always stand behind you.”<br><br>Milland smiled broadly, which was uncommon of him.<br><br>“Then, can I make my first request of the commander?”<br><br>“Request? Of me?”<br><br>“There was one thing I’ve always wanted to request.”<br><br>“I’m listening.”<br><br>He nodded, gesturing that anything was fine.<br><br>“Can you spar with me in four months?”<br><br>Raon didn’t want to miss the last opportunity he could get in Habun Castle.<br><br>“That’s not a difficult request. But do you think four months will be enough?”<br><br>“Yes, that should…”<br><br>Crimson combative spirit was reflected in Raon’s eyes.<br><br>“…allow me to avoid a disgraceful defeat.”<br><br> <br><br>* * *<br><br> <br><br>Since one bowl of soup wasn’t enough to fill his stomach, Raon and Dorian headed to the Branch of Frost after leaving the conference room.<br><br>“Huh? Sir Raon!”<br><br>Once they opened the door and entered, Yua—who’d been cleaning the tables—came running at them.<br><br>“Are you okay now?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>He’d heard the same question countless times that day, but he couldn’t help smiling because it was Yua that said it.<br><br>“What a relief.”<br><br>Yua fluttered her twin tails, which looked like bunny ears, and sniffled.<br><br>“Yua kept visiting you to drop off some food and snacks. The soup you had earlier was also made by Yua.”<br><br>Dorian pat Yua’s head to praise her.<br><br>“I see.”<br><br>As he’d expected, Yua had made that delicious soup.<br><br>“There was no snack though.”<br><br>“Ahem, that’s because I was a bit hungry…”<br><br>Dorian awkwardly cleared his throat and turned his head away.<br><br>“Anyway.”<br><br>Raon snickered and sat at the table.<br><br>“Can I order right now?”<br><br>“Of course. Grandfather is up as well. Grandfather!”<br><br>Yua shouted towards the kitchen and the manager, whose complexion was much better now, came running out.<br><br>“You are here!”<br><br>He took the bandana off his head and bowed politely.<br><br>“I wasn’t in my right mind last time, and I couldn’t even thank you properly. Thank you for saving us.”<br><br>“Me, too. Thank you for saving me and grandfather.”<br><br>Yua copied the manager and bowed at a 90-degree angle.<br><br>“You don’t need to do all that.”<br><br>Raon shook his head and made the manager and Yua stand. It was just making him feel embarrassed, since he didn’t save them to get that kind of treatment.<br><br>“I heard that I managed to survive thanks to Sir Raon’s quick first aid. I don’t even know how to repay this favor…”<br><br>“Your healthy appearance is enough reward for me.”<br><br>Raon smiled gently and shook his head.<br><br>“Ah, this isn’t the time for this.”<br><br>The manager tapped his forehead and placed the menu on the table.<br><br>“Please order anything you want.”<br><br>“Grandfather said that it’s free for Sir Raon for the rest of his life!”<br><br>“Huh? Then, what about me?”<br><br>Dorian pointed at himself with his finger.<br><br>“Sir Dorian needs to pay, of course!”<br><br>Yua put her hands on her waist, raising her chin.<br><br>“Wow, are you discriminating right now? How many sales do you think I made for you?”<br><br>“Hehehe!”<br><br>Dorian, Yua, and the manager burst into laughter.<br><br>Whatever is fine, so make the order already. The King of Essence wants the apple meat pie for now.<br><br>Wrath came out of the bracelet, rolling his eyes.<br><br>“Hmm, then…”<br><br>Raon ordered the apple meat pie that Wrath wanted, then a stew, a grilled duck, and a cheese pizza.<br><br>“Please wait a moment. We will bring you the best meal!”<br><br>Fifteen minutes later, food that was made more earnestly than ever filled the table. It had a great fragrance, but the quantity was also a lot more than usual.<br><br>They look particularly great today. Raise your weapon already.<br><br>Listening to the exploding sound of Wrath’s salivary glands, Raon picked up his spoon.<br><br>‘He is such a troublesome demon king.’<br><br> <br><br>* * *<br><br><br><br>Since he hadn’t had a proper meal in a while, it seemed even more delicious. It wasn’t just Wrath—Raon was also smiling in satisfaction.<br><br>“Thank you for the meal.”<br><br>“Sir Raon.”<br><br>As Raon was about to return after paying, the manager raised his hand.<br><br>“You mentioned you had something to tell me about Yua. May I hear what that was?”<br><br>“Hmm…”<br><br>Raon was looking for an opportunity to tell him, so he was glad he asked.<br><br>“Do you already know who tried to kidnap Yua?”<br><br>“It was Eden, right? Although, I’m not sure why they did that…”<br><br>“The reason Eden is targeting Yua is simple.”<br><br>Raon continued, looking at Yua, who was standing next to the manager with trembling hands.<br><br>“It’s because they wanted her to wear the Siren’s mask.”<br><br>“Siren’s mask?”<br><br>“A Siren is a mermaid monster that is half human and half fish. It has the ability to charm people by singing and playing instruments.”<br><br>“Singing and playing instruments? No way!”<br><br>The manager’s eyes widened as he realized what he meant.<br><br>“Yua is talented with music, to a point where even I recognize it when I know nothing other than swinging a sword. Eden was targeting that talent and tried turning Yua into a Siren.”<br><br>“Ah…”<br><br>The manager’s expression grew stiff as Raon continued.<br><br>“As long as Yua stays in Habun Castle, they will keep targeting her by using various methods. They are insane, after all.”<br><br>“I-I see.”<br><br>The manager slowly turned his head to look at Yua. It appeared that he had somewhat expected that to happen.<br><br>“Since Eden’s actions will get more and more violent in the future, they might put other people in danger on top of Yua next time. That’s why I wanted to suggest that you come with me when I return to my house.”<br><br>“That we’d go to Zieghart with you?”<br><br>“Yes, because we shouldn’t separate the two of you.”<br><br>Raon immediately nodded. Since Zieghart was antagonizing the Five Demons, they would certainly accept them if he explained the circumstances to them.<br><br>“Hmm… Sir Raon.”<br><br>The manager looked at him while softly pressing on the counter.<br><br>“This question might sound weird, but may I ask why you are being so kind to us?”<br><br>“That’s…”<br><br>Raon’s eyes returned to the past upon hearing the manager’s question.<br><br>He’d lived as an assassin, a hunting dog for his entire life after getting kidnapped in the childhood that he couldn’t even remember properly.<br><br>Infiltration, murder, invasion, theft, manipulation of information, and more. He didn’t want to do any of them, yet he kept completing Derus’ orders as they resonated in his head.<br><br>If Yua were to wear the Siren’s mask, her life would become even more brutal than his previous life had been. It was a given that she would shed blood every day with her own hands, for the rest of her life.<br><br>Because he’d personally experienced that hell, he didn’t want a normal kid that liked to sing and cook to shed other people’s blood.<br><br>That was all there was to it.<br><br>“Because I have to do it.”<br><br>Raon gave a slightly awkward smile, hiding his feelings.<br><br>“I see.”<br><br>It looked like the manager liked that answer, smiling gently as he looked at Yua.<br><br>“Erm, Sir Raon!”<br><br>Yua raised her hand to ask a question.<br><br>“Huh?”<br><br>“Can I become stronger like Sir Raon? Will I be able to protect Grandfather and beat up the bad guys?”<br><br>“Ah…”<br><br>Since it was a completely unexpected situation, Rano’s eyes widened.<br><br>‘I was mistaken…’<br><br>He was only thinking about bringing Yua with him to protect her, but she actually wanted to get stronger herself.<br><br>It looked like she wanted to forget the terrifying scene of her family being devoured by a monster, to move on.<br><br>That girl’s talent is the real deal. Even though it’s different from swordsmanship, releasing that talent would make her stronger.<br><br>Wrath was right. She had the talent, and she desired to fight. It was only right for him to show her the path, just like Rimmer did for him.<br><br>“Of course! I also used to be a coward before coming to Zieghart!”<br><br>Dorian interrupted before Raon responded.<br><br>“But you are still a coward.”<br><br>Raon snickered, putting his hand on Dorian’s shoulder.<br><br>“I-I’m not a coward! I just have a slight hand tremor!”<br><br>He is the most cowardliest of the cowards.<br><br>Wrath clicked his tongue.<br><br>“Do you want to protect yourself and your grandfather with your own power?”<br><br>Raon leaned forward to meet Yua’s gaze.<br><br>“Yes!”<br><br>“You should be able to if you desire it.”<br><br>“I’ll go then!”<br><br>Yua gave a refreshing smile and clenched her fist.<br><br>“Since she wants to go, I can’t stop her. I think I can trust anything Sir Raon says. Please take care of her in the future.”<br><br>“You don’t need to do this.”<br><br>The manager was trying to kneel and bow, and Raon stopped him in a haste.<br><br>“But if you are sending Yua…”<br><br>“I’m not going.”<br><br>“What?”<br><br>“Grandfather!”<br><br>Yua ran up to him and grabbed his sleeve.<br><br>“Wh-What are you talking about? We have to go together!”<br><br>“I’ve lived here for my entire life. I’m not going anywhere.”<br><br>“The same goes for me!”<br><br>“If I were to leave, that would be the end of this pub. I don’t even have a long life in front of me. I just want you to live on happily.”<br><br>The manager smiled faintly. It looked like he already made up his mind.<br><br>“Then I’m not going either!”<br><br>“Why would you not? You keep complaining every day that it’s cold and narrow.”<br><br>“Regardless of how great it is, I’m not going if it’s not with my grandfather!”<br><br>Their voices got louder as they grabbed onto each other’s clothes.<br><br>“Let’s go.”<br><br>Leaving the arguing people behind, Raon left the pub.<br><br>“Can we leave them like that?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>He nodded, taking a glance at the Branch of Frost, where loud voices were still coming from.<br><br>“It’s up to them to decide.”<br><br> <br><br>* * *<br><br> <br><br>Slightly past the dinner time, Raon returned to the scout’s quarters and changed. It was the opposite from his usual routine, where he trained until it was late at night.<br><br>You’ve finally gone insane.<br><br>Wrath poked his head out of the bracelet, snickering.<br><br>‘That’s not the case.’<br><br>Raon laid on the bed and shook his head.<br><br>What?<br><br>‘I need to check how effective Sloth, which increases the stats just from sleeping, is.’<br><br>Sloth, which he had obtained from the monarch of the same name, was an ability that would make him stronger while he slept.<br><br>‘I need to know how many stats I get before planning for the fight against the commander in four months.’<br><br>A fight against a Master level warrior was a golden opportunity for him. He had no intention of wasting it like an idiot.<br><br>He needed to confront him in his best condition and state, so he first needed to properly test the ability he’d obtained.<br><br>‘Let’s see how much stronger I get by sleeping.’<br><br>Raon smiled in excitement and covered himself with a blanket.</p>
