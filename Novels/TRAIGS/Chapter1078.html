        <p>"Mmm..."<br><br>Raon opened his eyes with a faint groan.<br><br>'Did I pass out?'<br><br>He remembered completing the Soul Sword through his training, but had no memory after that. It seemed he had lost consciousness right after creating the Soul Sword.<br><br>-That's exactly what happened!<br><br>Wrath jumped in front of him with a furrowed brow.<br><br>-How many times did I tell you to rest while training! You weak fool!<br><br>'I had no choice.'<br><br>Raon shook his head as he rose from the bed.<br><br>'My mind was tingling with anticipation.'<br><br>Having grasped the key to creating the Soul Sword and finished planning how to make it, he couldn't afford to take his time. His desire to create a perfect Soul Sword had completely erased his need for sleep. He poured all his sleeping hours into honing his sword of the heart.<br><br>'This is...'<br><br>Not the annex building. Looking at the clean, high ceiling, he realized it was his temporary quarters at the training ground.<br><br>"Ugh!"<br><br>Raon stretched as he got out of bed.<br><br>'This worked out well. Not just physical fatigue, but mental fatigue has been cleared too.'<br><br>His body and mind felt light, as if the fatigue accumulated from training with Glenn and Darkan had vanished through sleep.<br><br>[Willpower has strengthened.]<br><br>[The demon kings' Authority has strengthened.]<br><br>[The realm of the soul has risen.]<br><br>[Trait has risen by two levels.]<br><br>Raon nodded as he saw the messages he had seen before passing out.<br><br>'It was the perfect moment.'<br><br>Through training with Glenn and Darkan, his Willpower and swordsmanship had grown, and his Soul Sword had improved dramatically. It felt like he had achieved everything he wanted.<br><br>'Shall we go back to training then?'<br><br>Wanting to try out his Soul Sword and resume training with Glenn and Darkan, he strapped the Heavenly Drive and Wooden Ring Sword to his waist before heading out.<br><br>-Eat before training!<br><br>Wrath blocked his path with furrowed brows.<br><br>-I-I'm not saying this because I want to eat, but because you'll harm your body if you don't eat properly. You're still growing.<br><br>'But I'm already grown up?'<br><br>Raon shook his head as he looked at his tall stature and broad shoulders in the mirror.<br><br>'Any bigger and I'll become a troll.'<br><br>He lowered his hand, saying it was just right.<br><br>'And wipe the drool from your mouth before saying such things.'<br><br>Raon sighed as he wiped the drool from Wrath's mouth.<br><br>-A-anyway, let's eat! It's breakfast time!<br><br>'Alright, alright.'<br><br>Since Wrath, unlike usual, didn't argue about the reward messages and acknowledged them, he decided to listen to him today. After quickly washing his face, Raon headed to the dining hall in the main building.<br><br>"You're awake?"<br><br>Darkan nodded while eating the mountain of food on his plate with his hands. Looking at his manner, it seemed he hadn't broken his habits from his beggar days.<br><br>"Youth certainly is wonderful. Recovery is quick."<br><br>He smiled with his youthful face, saying he was envious.<br><br>“What’s the plan for today’s training?”<br><br>"I'll participate, of course."<br><br>Raon sat across from Darkan after getting food on his large plate.<br><br>-Ugh.<br><br>Wrath frowned while looking at the main building's dining hall menu.<br><br>-Why does the menu here always repeat! After chicken stew, it's always stir-fried beef, and then the next day it's fried pork!<br><br>He sniffled, saying he missed the varied menu of the annex building.<br><br>'You sure want a lot.'<br><br>Raon quickly finished his meal, leaving the whining Wrath be.<br><br>-Chomp chomp...<br><br>After finishing his meal, Wrath smacked his lips contentedly.<br><br>-At least it tastes good, thankfully.<br><br>He nodded in satisfaction despite his earlier complaints. What a peculiar demon king he was. When they arrived at the training ground with Darkan, Glenn was waiting as if he knew they would come.<br><br>"Let's begin."<br><br>Glenn drew the Heavenly Tremor with his usual cold gaze, as if he had left any sense of pride from last night at the training ground.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Having hoped for this, he calmly nodded and raised the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>"Here I come."<br><br>Glenn left a brief warning before approaching and bringing down the Heavenly Tremor. His Willpower felt even stronger than yesterday.<br><br>'I can block it.'<br><br>Raon summoned both his Willpower and the demon kings' Authority to the blade of the Heavenly Drive, determined not to retreat. Clash! A powerful collision rang out as the rising Heavenly Drive met the descending Heavenly Tremor. Though the sound was similar to yesterday's, there was one difference. Crackle!<br><br>Raon wasn't backing down from Glenn's sword strike, raising his sword-holding hand.<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>Glenn narrowed his eyes in surprise.<br><br>"W-what! His Willpower has grown that much? Is he a magician rather than a swordsman?"<br><br>Darkan also clicked his teeth in surprise at his sword. Rumble! Raon pressed his lips together as he watched Glenn's Heavenly Tremor being pushed back by the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>'To think this would work...'<br><br>Thanks to yesterday's realization, his Willpower had grown stronger, and the demon kings' Authority had developed to provide great help. However, what played the biggest role now was the harmony between Willpower and Authority. A red line connected to his soul linked with the Authorities, manifesting powerful will. Crack!<br><br>Finally, Raon made the Heavenly Tremor retreat for the first time during training.<br><br>'It worked!'<br><br>Of course, Glenn was holding back, but Raon couldn't help smiling as he seemed to have passed his test.<br><br>"You're truly insane!"<br><br>Darkan jumped up and clapped his hands in disbelief.<br><br>"What in the world happened!"<br><br>His eyes trembled as he said that even forging the Soul Sword couldn't explain this.<br><br>"Did you gain some insight different from the Soul Sword?"<br><br>Glenn also narrowed his eyes in curiosity.<br><br>"No. It was possible because I realized the Soul Sword and Willpower are connected."<br><br>He discovered that just as Willpower manifests his wishes in reality, the demon kings' Authority seeks to draw out his desires. By carefully combining these two similar yet different powers, he was able to display such martial prowess.<br><br>"Teach him one thing and he figures out a hundred."<br><br>Darkan curled his lips, saying it was worth teaching him.<br><br>"It seems you've grasped the thread of the power you wanted."<br><br>Glenn nodded with a deep smile, as if immediately understanding his condition.<br><br>"This level won't do anymore."<br><br>He summoned even more powerful Willpower and aura to the Heavenly Tremor.<br><br>"Ah, I'm not ready for that level yet..."<br><br>Raon's jaw trembled as he watched Glenn's fiercely burning Heavenly Tremor.<br><br>"We shouldn't do training that the Light Wind Palace Master can handle."<br><br>Glenn shook his head with a cold smile. He seemed to know that he was tormenting – no, training the Light Wind division.<br><br>-Puhehehehe!<br><br>Wrath held his plump belly while mocking him.<br><br>-I knew this would happen!<br><br>He sneered, saying it served him right.<br><br>"Let's not waste time and train like our lives depend on it."<br><br>Glenn fiercely swung down the Heavenly Tremor, suggesting intense training like how he taught the Light Wind Palace swordsmen.<br><br>"Karma..."<br><br>Raon gritted his teeth as he watched Glenn's Heavenly Tremor falling like lightning.<br><br>"I'll gladly accept it!"<br><br>***<br><br>After finishing the grueling training with Glenn, Raon went to find Darkan.<br><br>"Shall we see how much your swordsmanship has improved, apart from Willpower?"<br><br>Darkan nodded, suggesting they start immediately.<br><br>"The first sword technique is the defensive sword, Fire Wall."<br><br>Raon nodded and unleashed the Fire Wall technique of the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation. Whoosh! A shield of red flames blazed intensely as if to protect his entire body.<br><br>"Huh...?"<br><br>Darkan lowered his eyebrows as he watched.<br><br>"W-what? Why hasn't the sword technique's essence changed?"<br><br>He tilted his head as if asking why the Ten Thousand Swords hadn't improved.<br><br>"Your Willpower has grown so much, so why is your swordsmanship the same!"<br><br>"That's only natural."<br><br>Raon let out a hollow laugh as he looked at Darkan.<br><br>"What I realized yesterday was about Willpower and Soul Sword, not sword techniques."<br><br>While it was true that his martial prowess had strengthened after realizing the connection between Soul Sword and Willpower, naturally there hadn't been much change in his swordsmanship.<br><br>"Ugh!"<br><br>Darkan let out a pained groan.<br><br>"I wanted to be impressed too..."<br><br>He clicked his tongue in disappointment.<br><br>"Aren't you impressed every day already?"<br><br>Raon smirked as he swung the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>"That's true. I've never seen a monster who grows as fast as you."<br><br>Darkan laughed, saying he had only called two people monsters.<br><br>"Second? Then the first was..."<br><br>"Right over there."<br><br>He pointed his finger behind him at Glenn.<br><br>"Your grandfather is a crazy monster too. Though not as much as you."<br><br>Darkan shook his head, saying what an unlucky family.<br><br>"Let's start again."<br><br>"Alright."<br><br>Raon took his stance and unleashed Fire Wall. Whoosh! Unlike the first time, he created a rectangular shield that could protect a wider area.<br><br>"Again!"<br><br>Darkan shook his head as if that wasn't it.<br><br>"I know."<br><br>Raon said he could feel it himself and unleashed Fire Wall again. Whoosh! This time, the shield of flames curved and rotated like a flexible sword. He had incorporated the essence of not just blocking the sword, but deflecting it.<br><br>"So it hasn't remained completely unchanged."<br><br>Darkan exclaimed in surprise, as if he hadn't expected him to find the answer so quickly.<br><br>"But it's still rough! Again!"<br><br>"Understood."<br><br>Though there was no time to rest, Raon smiled as he repeatedly unleashed Fire Wall.<br><br>"The will and desire to become stronger."<br><br>Glenn showed a faint smile as he watched Raon thrust his sword without hesitation.<br><br>"I wonder how far you'll go."<br><br>He lowered his gaze with a clear yet bitter smile.<br><br>'Though I don't know if I'll be able to see it...'<br><br>***<br><br>After dinner, Raon stood before Glenn and Darkan.<br><br>"Now we can finally have a proper conversation."<br><br>Darkan grinned as he lowered his chin.<br><br>"Sit down."<br><br>Glenn gestured at the chair behind him, telling him to sit.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Raon bowed his head and sat across from Glenn.<br><br>"You now understand that the Soul Sword manifests the will contained in your soul, right?"<br><br>"Yes. I understand."<br><br>Having just realized it yesterday, his mind was still burning with the insight.<br><br>"I wanted a sword that could cut any enemy, you wanted an unbreakable sword, and this madman wanted a place where he could fight."<br><br>Glenn pointed to himself, Raon, and Darkan in turn as he explained each of their forged Soul Swords.<br><br>"That mysterious power has similarities with Sword Domain."<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>Raon's eyes widened as soon as he heard Glenn's words.<br><br>"Now that you mention it..."<br><br>The Sword Domain also manifested in different forms according to the swordsman's wishes among the Zieghart Direct Lineage. Thinking about it now, the Soul Sword that manifested the will residing in the soul seemed similar to the Sword Domain.<br><br>"I agree."<br><br>Darkan playfully made wave motions with his finger.<br><br>"I kept researching the Sword Domain, but nothing worked. However, after understanding the Soul Sword, I could feel something changing within me."<br><br>He nodded calmly, as if he had already discussed this with Glenn.<br><br>"That's why I think it might be possible to harmonize the two."<br><br>Glenn nodded, suggesting that they might be able to create a new form of martial arts by harmonizing the Soul Sword and Sword Domain.<br><br>"Then..."<br><br>"It would probably create swordsmanship that transcends even causality."<br><br>His calm eyes flashed with certainty about the outcome.<br><br>"Power that transcends causality..."<br><br>Darkan slowly licked his lips.<br><br>"I want to experience it! I want to endure it with my own body!"<br><br>He trembled the hand holding the dark sword, showing his sincerity.<br><br>"Go die..."<br><br>Raon shook his head, telling him to come to his senses.<br><br>"Head of House, can you achieve that state?"<br><br>Ignoring the increasingly deranged Darkan, he turned his attention to Glenn.<br><br>"No, I cannot reach it."<br><br>Glenn lowered his eyes heavily.<br><br>"My vessel is already full. I will disappear before reaching that realm."<br><br>He waved his hand as if saying that path wasn't meant for him.<br><br>"Then..."<br><br>"You can go in my place."<br><br>Glenn placed his hand on Raon's shoulder, showing his faith in him.<br><br>"What? How could I do something even you couldn't..."<br><br>"Your talent and capacity are greater than mine. It won't be long before you surpass my current level."<br><br>He smiled softly, as if looking forward to that time.<br><br>"H-how could I..."<br><br>Raon's lips trembled as he met Glenn's trusting gaze.<br><br>"That's why this fellow and I are here."<br><br>Glenn raised his finger to point at himself and Darkan.<br><br>"Training the Soul Sword is simple. It's all about endlessly refining and honing your soul to sharpen its edge."<br><br>He continued while gripping the hilt of the Heavenly Tremor.<br><br>"The problem is that it takes a long time and mental fatigue prevents extended training, but there's a way to solve that."<br><br>As Glenn nodded, a chilling shiver ran down Raon's spine.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>Raon's jaw trembled as he looked into Glenn's calm eyes.<br><br>'It's right in front of my eyes.'<br><br>Though invisible, he could sense Glenn's Soul Sword floating before him.<br><br>"Draw out your sword."<br><br>"Yes..."<br><br>Raon swallowed dryly and summoned his Soul Sword, still the size of a dagger. Though invisible to others, he could see it burning with flames and frost.<br><br>"Good."<br><br>As Darkan nodded with a smile, the presence of his massive and majestic Soul Sword could be felt before him.<br><br>"Bring it closer."<br><br>Glenn extended his Soul Sword forward slightly.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Good."<br><br>Raon and Darkan nodded and brought their Soul Swords next to Glenn's. Whoosh! As the three Soul Swords gathered in one place, a mysterious resonance occurred and white mist spread around the training ground.<br><br>"It's the soul's resonance."<br><br>Glenn calmly lowered his chin as he watched the white energy flow spread like a barrier.<br><br>"Within this space, the soul loosens, allowing faster forging of the Soul Sword."<br><br>He raised his finger, explaining that because this space was created by gathered Soul Swords, the soul naturally becomes more sensitive.<br><br>"Then..."<br><br>"Yes. It means not just you, but all of us can develop our Soul Swords faster."<br><br>Glenn drew a gentle smile as if asking what he thought.<br><br>"Even though it's small, with one more added, the space itself feels different."<br><br>Darkan smacked his lips, saying it felt much better than when it was just him and Glenn.<br><br>"Try forging your Soul Sword by refining your soul as usual."<br><br>Glenn closed his eyes after advising him to focus on the internal and ignore the external.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Raon sat beside Glenn and lowered his eyelids. As when usually training his Soul Sword, he summoned his aura and Willpower to strike his soul. Clang! As Glenn said, his soul flowed more smoothly than before, becoming the blade of his Soul Sword. It really felt like the boundaries of the soul were loosening within this space.<br><br>-Where else can you find such an overpowered training method!<br><br>Wrath gaped in disbelief.<br><br>-This doesn't make any sense! None!<br><br>'After all that hard work, I deserve at least this much.'<br><br>Raon smirked as he pushed away the struggling Wrath.<br><br>'Let me taste some sweetness too.'<br><br>-You're always tasting sweetness! Sucking it up yesterday, sucking it up today!<br><br>Wrath pointed at his mouth, saying Raon had no conscience.<br><br>-Your teeth will rot at this rate!<br><br>'Ah, so sweet.'<br><br>-Arghhhh!<br><br>***<br><br>Another two weeks passed, completing the promised month.<br><br>"I'm ready."<br><br>Raon bowed to Glenn, who stood with his hands behind his back, and Darkan, who was picking his ear, then slowly caught his breath.<br><br>'Let's just do what we learned.'<br><br>Over the month, he had developed his Willpower, swordsmanship, and Soul Sword, raising his martial prowess to a higher level. Having prepared thoroughly, he felt he could now overcome even the test Glenn had personally prepared.<br><br>"Then let's begin."<br><br>An invisible, formless energy rose before Glenn. It was a supreme Soul Sword that mercilessly cut through the enemy's soul.<br><br>"Hoo."<br><br>Raon calmly closed and opened his eyes. Extending his hand as if gripping a sword, he summoned the Soul Sword forged from his soul. A slightly longer Soul Sword appeared before his eyes. The flames and frost burning on both sides of the blade emitted an even more intense light than before.<br><br>"Don't worry about what's behind you, do as you please."<br><br>Darkan nodded while summoning his own Soul Sword to prevent any possible accidents.<br><br>"Here I come."<br><br>Glenn sent his Soul Sword flying toward him with a low voice. Bang! The sword of heart he created transcended time and space, appearing before his soul. It was a sharp and swift sword, as if truly intent on killing his own grandson. Whoosh!<br><br>The moment Glenn's Soul Sword moved, Raon brought down his own Soul Sword before his soul.<br><br>'I can never win in a head-on confrontation.'<br><br>Even though Glenn was holding back, there was a stark difference between their Soul Swords. In a normal contest, he wouldn't be able to withstand it.<br><br>'But that doesn't mean there's no way.'<br><br>The moment Glenn's Soul Sword tried to pierce his soul, he unleashed Fire Wall with his Soul Sword. Whoosh! The curved shield made of soul energy rotated its curved sides as if deflection rather than blocking had been its purpose all along, smoothly redirecting Glenn's Soul Sword. Bang!<br><br>Glenn's Soul Sword, which had been targeting his soul, sliced through empty air before fading away futilely.<br><br>"Haaa..."<br><br>Raon knelt down, cold sweat streaming down his face.<br><br>'I-I blocked it, right?'<br><br>Until now, Darkan had blocked dangerous moments, but this was the first time he had deflected Glenn's Soul Sword himself. One success out of hundreds of attempts. Even though Glenn had gone easy on him, it was still a great achievement for him.<br><br>"You actually did it!"<br><br>Darkan slapped his back in disbelief.<br><br>"You really are insane!"<br><br>He showered praise with a voice that threatened to burst his throat.<br><br>"The harmony of the Ten Thousand Swords learned from Darkan, the strengthening of Willpower gained from me, and the growth of the Soul Sword achieved in between."<br><br>Glenn extended his hand to him.<br><br>"You poured everything you learned this month into it. Excellent!"<br><br>He transformed his stiff expression into a radiant smile, seemingly truly moved.<br><br>"It's thanks to both of you teaching me well."<br><br>Raon took Glenn's hand, stood up, and bowed his head.<br><br>"I taught you because it was fun too. I gained a lot as well."<br><br>Darkan grinned, saying he had gained interesting things.<br><br>"I also learned something. Though it was training for you, it helped me as well."<br><br>Glenn smiled faintly, seeming satisfied himself.<br><br>"You've worked hard. Sylvia and Sia have been lingering around here wanting to see you, so go back now."<br><br>Glenn rubbed his chin, saying this concluded the month of training.<br><br>-Finally, we're going back!<br><br>Wrath started dancing in celebration.<br><br>-Home cooking! We can finally eat home cooking!<br><br>He reddened his eyes, saying he almost died missing the annex building's meals. Crying over food - he was still a demon king who couldn't adjust.<br><br>"Thank you for everything."<br><br>Raon bowed deeply to Glenn and Darkan.<br><br>"Drop the formalities. The polite speech makes me cringe."<br><br>Darkan waved his hand as if he disliked the polite speech even more.<br><br>"Wait. I should tell you this in advance. Starting tomorrow..."<br><br>Glenn continued in a light tone, as if discussing an ordinary matter.<br><br>"We will begin selecting the successor."</p>
