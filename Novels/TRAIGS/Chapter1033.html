        <p>With a thunderous roar, Raon unleashed Glacier's cold energy, freezing the sinking White Blood Religion's ship along with the sea.<br><br>"Martha."<br><br>He approached Martha, who was pointing her sword at the apostle on the ship's deck.<br><br>"Are you alright?"<br><br>"I'm perfectly fine."<br><br>Martha said, then coughed up black blood. She nodded, claiming to be fine despite her clearly unwell expression.<br><br>"How did you manage to catch this guy?"<br><br>Raon supported Martha, whose legs were trembling as if about to collapse, while using the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation's heat to keep the apostle immobilized.<br><br>-I'm curious about that too.<br><br>Wrath exhaled sharply while looking at Martha.<br><br>-It should have been an opponent impossible to defeat with the beef girl's martial prowess alone.<br><br>'The difference isn't just in strength. This ship is imbued with blood magic.'<br><br>He couldn't understand how she had won, given that the blood magic on the ship would have empowered the apostle while hindering Martha.<br><br>"At first, I was pushed back. No, there wasn't a single moment when I had the upper hand."<br><br>Martha nodded gravely, confirming that he had indeed been an extremely difficult opponent.<br><br>"Even when I realized the advice you gave me before and swung my sword with anger in my soul, I was still overwhelmed in the end."<br><br>She let out a low groan as she looked at her sword stained with the apostle's blood.<br><br>"It wasn't me who did it, but the swordsmanship."<br><br>Martha swallowed dryly and raised her gaze.<br><br>"Swordsmanship?"<br><br>"When that guy's bloody energy reached its peak and was about to pierce my throat, the flow of the Crushing Ocean Sword changed. As if understanding my emotions, my soul, it broke through the bloody energy and slashed his chest."<br><br>She took a deep breath, saying she wasn't sure what she had done herself.<br><br>"Crushing Ocean Sword..."<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he looked at Martha's trembling gaze.<br><br>'The Crushing Ocean Sword must be the technique Denier personally taught Martha.'<br><br>Martha had previously shown him the Crushing Ocean Sword, saying it was a technique Denier had taught her directly. He hadn't thought it was particularly impressive aside from the subtleties of the Crushing Sword, but hearing her words today, it seemed there was something special about it.<br><br>'You really are a person full of mysteries.'<br><br>The more he learned about Denier, the more questions arose, leaving him feeling rather frustrated.<br><br>"I really wanted to kill him, but I held back."<br><br>Martha spat out the blood pooling in her mouth, saying she could have killed the apostle but chose not to.<br><br>"Why...?"<br><br>Raon looked at Martha, who was gritting her teeth as if regretting her decision.<br><br>"Because this pig isn't my real target."<br><br>Martha smiled coldly, saying that her target wasn't the apostle, but the leader of the White Blood Religion.<br><br>"He admitted with his own mouth that he's one of the Apostles. Try to extract as much information as you can."<br><br>She said "please" and then sat down on the tilting deck. Judging by the blood continuously flowing from her mouth, her internal injuries seemed severe.<br><br>"Looks like you're growing up a bit now."<br><br>Raon lightly patted Martha's shoulder, telling her she'd done well.<br><br>-Indeed! The beef girl has grown a lot!<br><br>Wrath nodded emphatically, saying he had thought she was still a child when they last communicated, but now she had grown up.<br><br>-It's time to send her off to get married. Sniff...<br><br>'Are you Martha's mother?'<br><br>Raon looked at the sniffling Wrath with an incredulous expression.<br><br>"It might be a bit late to say this now, but I'm your older sister, you know?"<br><br>Martha tapped his forehead with her finger, reminding him not to forget that she was a year older.<br><br>"I'll keep that in mind."<br><br>Raon nodded with a faint smile.<br><br>"Light Wind Palace, eliminate all remaining Blood Demons!"<br><br>After ordering the Light Wind Palace swordsmen who had come with him on the Azure Wind to kill the Blood Demons remaining in the port and sea, he approached the Ninth Apostle.<br><br>"Urgh..."<br><br>The Ninth Apostle was trying to forcibly close the wound that ran from his shoulder to his waist using the regenerative abilities of his bloody energy.<br><br>Judging by the white color of his blood, he was at least a Grandmaster High Rank or above.<br><br>"Looking at the situation, I can guess roughly, but..."<br><br>Raon tilted his chin as he looked down at the Ninth Apostle.<br><br>"I'd like you to tell me directly with your own mouth. What have you been doing with this ship until now?"<br><br>"Hehehe!"<br><br>The Ninth Apostle spat out dead blood from his mouth and sneered.<br><br>"Ask that wench."<br><br>"Seems like you enjoy unnecessary effort."<br><br>Raon drew his violently vibrating Blade of Requiem and thrust it into the Ninth Apostle's wound.<br><br>"Aaaaargh!"<br><br>The moment the Blade of Requiem's edge pierced his wound, the Ninth Apostle let out a scream that even children wouldn't make, as if his throat was being torn apart.<br><br>"Speak."<br><br>"Urgh..."<br><br>Despite feeling pain as if his entire body was being split apart due to the Blade of Requiem's demonic energy, the guy refused to open his mouth.<br><br>'This is the problem with the White Blood Religion.'<br><br>Raon frowned as he looked at the groaning Ninth Apostle.<br><br>'Whether they're low-ranking or executives, they won't open their mouths.'<br><br>Perhaps because they were brainwashed within the irrational system of a cult, not a single member of the White Blood Religion would speak even under torture. In a way, they were a group even more difficult to extract information from than Eden or Derus.<br><br>"Those guys did everything with this ship."<br><br>Martha spoke up after forcibly chewing and swallowing some internal injury medicine.<br><br>"This ship has magic engraved on it that absorbs bloody energy and blood. The Archbishop I killed manipulated people's minds to kidnap them, and they erased traces of bloody energy using the waves and the ship's magic."<br><br>She nodded, saying she had figured out all the information during the battle.<br><br>"I see."<br><br>Raon thanked her and gestured towards Martha.<br><br>"However, there's still an unexplained part."<br><br>He pointed a finger at the blue wolf watching this place with fierce eyes.<br><br>"What's that wolf?"<br><br>"..."<br><br>The Ninth Apostle kept his mouth shut this time as well, refusing to speak.<br><br>"Speak."<br><br>Raon frowned and sharpened the blade of the Blade of Requiem, stirring it in the Ninth Apostle's abdomen.<br><br>"Ugh! Aaaaargh!"<br><br>The Ninth Apostle screamed and thrashed his limbs in agony worse than death.<br><br>'There must be a connection.'<br><br>Raon lowered his eyebrows as he alternately examined the howling Ninth Apostle and the wolf whose malice was intensifying.<br><br>'There's no way such a wolf would appear without any reason.'<br><br>It was clear that such a special wolf with unique powers didn't just suddenly pop out of the sea. It must have been created through the White Blood Religion's magic.<br><br>"Urgh..."<br><br>The Ninth Apostle just groaned with his head drooping, as if determined not to speak even if it killed him.<br><br>'At this rate, he'll die before opening his mouth.'<br><br>It might be better to probe from a different angle.<br><br>He pulled the Blade of Requiem out of the Ninth Apostle's wound, who was foaming at the mouth but still refusing to answer.<br><br>"Urk..."<br><br>The Ninth Apostle exhaled a long breath and slowly raised his gaze.<br><br>"Kusar Pirates."<br><br>Raon mentioned the name of the Kusar Pirates he had recently annihilated as he looked at the Ninth Apostle who had barely regained his senses.<br><br>"Do you know that traces of your presence were found in their territory?"<br><br>He smiled faintly, saying traces had been found even though nothing had actually been discovered.<br><br>"What are you talking about..."<br><br>For the first time, the Ninth Apostle repeated his words, seemingly flustered.<br><br>"Thanks to the mistake you made in the Kusar Pirates' territory, we were able to wait here with certainty."<br><br>Raon tilted his chin while looking into the Ninth Apostle's eyes.<br><br>"It's not strange to make mistakes since it's your first time attacking a port."<br><br>"..."<br><br>The Ninth Apostle just wrinkled his nose bridge as if doubting his words, but didn't open his mouth.<br><br>However, this reaction allowed him to be certain that his prediction was correct.<br><br>'As expected, it seems the White Blood Religion started kidnapping people beginning with the Kusar Pirates' territory.'<br><br>He had probed because Paras said he had seen the ship only once, and judging by the Ninth Apostle's reaction, it really seemed that was where it all began.<br><br>"Usually, such operations start from nearby areas. If we search the surrounding seas, we might even find the White Blood Religion headquarters."<br><br>Raon smiled with just his lips as he examined the Ninth Apostle's face.<br><br>"Nonsense."<br><br>Although the Ninth Apostle's eyes didn't waver, befitting a Grandmaster, the speed at which he blinked noticeably increased, perhaps due to anxiety.<br><br>"Was it true? I should at least thank Paras for this."<br><br>Raon laughed as he mentioned the name of the already dead Kusar Pirates' captain.<br><br>"If we study this ship and get help from the Kusar Pirates, something will turn up."<br><br>He rolled his eyes, probing the Ninth Apostle once again.<br><br>"...Search for a thousand years. You won't find even an ant."<br><br>Although the Nine Apostle maintained a natural appearance this time as well, his speech was slightly drawn out.<br><br>It seemed that whether through this ship or the Kusar Pirates' territory, a path leading to the White Blood Religion would open if searched in detail.<br><br>"Moreover..."<br><br>"Kuhehe!"<br><br>Just as he was about to probe about the blue wolf, the Ninth Apostle interrupted him and started laughing maniacally.<br><br>"They say the Sword Emperor's tongue is sharper than his sword, and it's certainly not wrong."<br><br>The Ninth Apostle nodded heavily, seemingly realizing his act had been seen through.<br><br>"It's a sacrifice that should be offered to the Blood God, but given how things have turned out, there's no helping it..."<br><br>He revealed a detached look in his eyes, as if he had made some decision.<br><br>"Killing you here will be the better path for Him."<br><br>The Ninth Apostle stopped his regenerative abilities and released the remaining bloody energy in his body.<br><br>"It's futile."<br><br>Raon frowned as he placed his hand on the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>"True. I can't defeat you even in perfect condition. However..."<br><br>The Ninth Apostle looked at the sea, or rather, at the face of the blue wolf floating on the sea, and curled up the corners of his mouth.<br><br>“If it’s a sea spirit poisoned by blood energy, even you can be devoured!”<br><br>He let out a fierce cry and stabbed his own heart with his hand burning with bloody energy.<br><br>“A sea spirit poisoned by blood energy?”<br><br>"You were curious about what the blue wolf is, weren't you?"<br><br>The Ninth Apostle sneered while coughing up blood.<br><br>"I'll tell you. That wolf is the guardian spirit that has protected this sea since ancient times. Since this ship alone couldn't erase all the bloody energy, we subdued that spirit and taught it to devour the scattered bloody energy and blood."<br><br>He grinned, saying they used that spirit to erase traces of bloody energy and blood, and to raise waves.<br><br>"However, the spirit was too pure, so the change was much faster than expected. It accumulated blood and bloody energy to the point where I could barely control it."<br><br>The Ninth Apostle revealed his yellow teeth, saying the wolf with trembling eyes was on the verge of going berserk.<br><br>"You demonic bastards..."<br><br>Raon ground his molars deeply.<br><br>"I cast a blood curse on you and Zieghart."<br><br>As soon as the Ninth Apostle finished saying he was casting a curse, he burst into white blood.<br><br>With a thunderous boom, every bit of flesh and blood he left behind as he died fell onto the sea without exception. With a deep rumble, the blood magic remaining on the deck rose on its own and sucked all the blood and bloody energy left on the deck and port into the sea.<br><br>The sea beneath exploded with the Ninth Apostle's bloody energy and all the blood and bloody energy accumulated on the ship, sending up a terrifying light.<br><br>After the blinding light subsided, Raon lifted his eyelids to see that the storm raging in the sea had disappeared, and everything had settled into an eerie calm as if the whole world had fallen asleep. With a thunderous roar, an enormous wolf rose above the now-tranquil sea.<br><br>The wolf's entire body was burning so red it could no longer be described as blue, and the sea too seemed to be filled with blood, rising with a crimson light.<br><br>When the red wolf howled, the entire sea shook, and countless sea monsters rose up, enough to obscure the horizon. There were so many that even if he fought directly, he felt he might tire before killing them all.<br><br>"W-What is this!"<br><br>"Why did that wolf get even bigger! It's literally as big as the sea now!"<br><br>"I've never seen so many monsters..."<br><br>"Are we too late? What on earth..."<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen who arrived belatedly swallowed dry saliva as they looked at the endlessly accumulating monsters and the giant red wolf standing behind them.<br><br>"You're not late at all."<br><br>Raon nodded calmly as he looked at Burren, Runaan, and Trevin standing in front of the swordsmen.<br><br>"These are your opponents for real combat experience. Think you can handle it?"<br><br>He pointed at the monsters, addressing the newly arrived swordsmen.<br><br>"Not bad."<br><br>Burren nodded calmly.<br><br>"Yeah... I'll do it..."<br><br>Runaan placed her hand on her sword, not taking her eyes off Martha who was struggling to hold on.<br><br>"It's been a while since I've had a chance to stretch my muscles."<br><br>Trevin licked his lips, saying it looked like fun.<br><br>"Palace Master. I will assist you."<br><br>Mark Goetun stood behind him, indicating he would follow.<br><br>"No. Guardian, please help the swordsmen. My opponent is that thing."<br><br>Raon pointed his finger at the red wolf towering like a god behind the monsters. With a thunderous roar, the red wolf wrinkled its face as if displeased with him, then raised its head and let out a howl that shook the heavens.<br><br>"Urgh..."<br><br>"Aaargh!"<br><br>"What is this sound..."<br><br>Even the Master-level swordsmen groaned and clutched their heads, unable to withstand the red wolf's howl. However, the true effect of the cry wasn't just a mental attack; the sea raged as if angered, and enormous waves rose up.<br><br>With a thunderous crash, the sea monsters began charging towards the port, riding the waves raised by the wolf, their eyes clouded with madness.<br><br>'Even though it's intoxicated with bloody energy, does it still retain the power of a sea spirit?'<br><br>Seeing how naturally it commanded the monsters, even more so than the ghosts of Eden, Raon thought it really must have started as a sea spirit.<br><br>'There are too many. Should I help a little...?'<br><br>"Go quickly."<br><br>Martha waved her hand, seeing him hesitate.<br><br>"These are the people you've trusted and trained. They can do it, just like me."<br><br>She stood up, seemingly intending to fight despite her condition.<br><br>"There's always something to learn from you."<br><br>Raon nodded with a slight smile.<br><br>"Because I'm your older sister."<br><br>Martha tilted her chin as if reminding him to remember that fact.<br><br>"Me too..."<br><br>Runaan raised her hand as if asking to be included.<br><br>"Not you!"<br><br>"Not you."<br><br>-Not you!<br><br>Raon, Martha, and Wrath shook their heads simultaneously.<br><br>"Alright."<br><br>Raon turned to look at the Light Wind Palace swordsmen and smiled faintly.<br><br>"I'm counting on you."<br><br>After saying he was entrusting this to them, he leapt over the waves of incoming monsters and locked eyes with the red wolf, which was full of malice towards humans. With a low growl, the wolf that had once been a spirit snarled fiercely, its pure sea energy now filled with intense killing intent and bloody energy.<br><br>'That's no longer a spirit.'<br><br>Raon frowned at the stench of blood emanating from the wolf.<br><br>'It's closer to a berserk monster with only killing intent remaining.'<br><br>The bloody energy he sensed was on a different level from the apostle's. The sea spirit had now become something that could only be called a monster. With an earth-shaking roar, the red wolf rose from the sea that had turned to blood after letting out a howl that shook the entire ocean.<br><br>Its body seemed to be covered in steel-like fur, looking incredibly hard, and its size was so enormous it could block out the moon in the sky. It was as if a blood demon had descended upon the mortal world.<br><br>With a deafening screech, the red wolf, considering him an enemy, raised its front paw, larger than a ship, and slashed down through the air. It was a terrifying attack imbued with bloody energy even more intense than the apostle's. With a piercing sound, Raon swung the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation's Revolving Sky upward towards the red wolf's descending claws.<br><br>The sight of a human smaller than a claw forcefully repelling the red wolf that dominated the sea was as majestic and mysterious as a scene from a mythical hero's tale.<br><br>"How impudent."<br><br>Raon raised his chin as he looked at the red wolf's surprised eyes as it was pushed back.<br><br>"Sit. Good dog."</p>
