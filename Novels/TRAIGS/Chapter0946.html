        <p>"The Room of Self…"<br><br>Glenn narrowed his eyes as he looked at Raon.<br><br>"I haven't checked, but since no one has entered after Karoon, it should be accessible now."<br><br>He nodded, saying enough time had passed for the Room of Self to have regained its power.<br><br>-But why so suddenly?<br><br>"Through this recent war, I realized how much I still lack."<br><br>Raon let out a short sigh as he gazed at the reflection of the moon rippling on the lake's surface.<br><br>"My current martial prowess is probably on par with the upper ranks of the Five Divine Orders, like the Thespian Emperor or the Demon-Slaying Spear. Considering my age, it's almost unbelievable even to me, but…"<br><br>He bit his lip slightly as he looked at the clear moon that wasn't reflected in the lake.<br><br>"The enemies that the Light Wind Palace and I will face in the future go beyond that. The White Blood Religion, Eden, Derus Robert. None of them are easy opponents."<br><br>The leader of the White Blood Religion, the Fallen One, the Celestial Demon, and Derus Robert along with the angels. The enemies he had to face possessed overwhelming power he couldn't reach without the help of other Transcendants. To inflict even a deeper wound on them, he couldn't be satisfied with his current martial prowess. He had to move forward.<br><br>-Room of Self?<br><br>Wrath’s eyes darted around quickly as his lips trembled.<br><br>-That's why you told me to get used to the Nadine bread! You bastard!<br><br>He seemed to have realized the meaning behind Raon’s words and gritted his teeth.<br><br>-Pinhead! We've only eaten it once since we came home! Why are you so desperate to starve yourself?<br><br>Wrath shook his head and told Raon to stop tormenting him.<br><br>"We're not starving ourselves. We'll only eat Nadine bread."<br><br>-That's even worse!<br><br>We have to eat it.<br><br>Raon shook his head and pushed aside Wrath, who was attacking.<br><br>"There's no problem letting you enter the Room of Self. However…"<br><br>Glenn lowered his eyebrows slightly as if he was worried.<br><br>"Are you sure you'll be alright?"<br><br>"Pardon...?"<br><br>Raon tilted his head, not understanding Glenn’s words.<br><br>"What do you mean by that?"<br><br>He had received permission to enter the Room of Self a long time ago. He didn't understand what Glenn meant by asking if he would be alright.<br><br>"The Room of Self is the place swordsmen access to break through their walls. Many martial artists have broken through walls that had blocked them for years or even decades and advanced to the next stage."<br><br>Glenn raised his finger and drew a small door in the air.<br><br>"On the other hand, swordsmen who haven't encountered any walls returned from the Room of Self without gaining anything special. As you probably already know, there's no wall in front of you right now."<br><br>He frowned as if he knew all about Raon’s level and condition.<br><br>"One can only enter the Room of Self once. I'm asking if you're sure you want to enter now."<br><br>"Mmm…"<br><br>Raon stroked his chin and let out a low sigh.<br><br>-So that's the reason.<br><br>He didn't know that the Room of Self wouldn't have much effect if the swordsman wasn't facing a wall. Now he understood why Glenn had said those things.<br><br>"Originally, I had planned to send you to the Room of Self to help you reach Transcendence. But…"<br><br>Glenn slowly turned his gaze.<br><br>"You experienced pain and reached Transcendence through your own power. In a way, you created your own opportunity, so perhaps you won't lose much if you enter now."<br><br>He nodded with deep pain in his eyes as he looked at Raon.<br><br>"Mmm…"<br><br>Raon gestured towards Wrath.<br><br>‘What do you think?’<br><br>-Don't enter! I don't want to eat any more of that Nadine bread!<br><br>Wrath frowned, saying he could still feel the rubbery taste in his mouth.<br><br>-However, this king has seen many die hoarding those unused opportunities. They become useless if you keep them for too long.<br><br>He licked his lips and said it’s better to eat delicious food before it spoils.<br><br>"Thank you for the sincere advice."<br><br>Raon smiled slightly at Wrath, who had puffed out his cheeks.<br><br>"It's similar to what I was thinking."<br><br>The reason he had saved his opportunity to enter the Room of Self was to overcome the wall of Transcendence. Since there was no guarantee that he would reach the next level after Transcendence before he died, it was better to use it now and become a little stronger.<br><br>"The Room of Self was created by the First Patriarch, right?"<br><br>Raon looked at Glenn with his hand on the sheath of the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>"That's right."<br><br>Glenn nodded slowly.<br><br>"I've heard that the Room of Self was created even before the first Zieghart building was constructed. Obviously, I haven't seen it with my own eyes, so I'm not sure if it's true."<br><br>He lowered his finger and said that the Room of Self was one of the oldest places in Zieghart.<br><br>"Then I'll enter."<br><br>Raon said he had made his decision and clasped his hands together.<br><br>«If it was created by the First Patriarch, there might be other opportunities.»<br><br>The First Patriarch had planted seeds for the future in various places. If Glenn’s words were true, he might obtain some of the First Patriarch’s provisions in the Room of Self.<br><br>"Then I'll have to make preparations."<br><br>Glenn rubbed his chin as if he accepted Raon’s request.<br><br>"Now then…"<br><br>"Wait a moment, Grandpa."<br><br>Raon called Glenn ‘Grandpa’ and stopped him as he was about to leave.<br><br>"If you don't mind, could you demonstrate the Thunder Piercing Heaven?"<br><br>Before entering the Room of Self, he wanted to see the newly woven Thunder Piercing Heaven that Glenn had created.<br><br>"Ahem!"<br><br>Glenn cleared his throat and slightly shrugged his shoulders.<br><br>"Since you say it's a martial art you wove with the Azure Sky Sword and the Heavenly Thunder Arts, I'm so curious I won't be able to sleep. I really want to see it with Grandpa's sword."<br><br>—Well, if that's the case, I can't refuse! Alright! Follow me!<br><br>He seemed to be in a good mood, his earlobes reddening as he headed towards the foot of North Grave Mountain on the other side of the lake.<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>Raon smiled and followed Glenn across the lake.<br><br>-So you finally figured out how to butter up old Nadine bread…<br><br>Wrath frowned as he watched Raon’s light steps.<br><br>-You're too slow!&nbsp;Clueless idiot!<br><br>He snorted and said Raon should have done this three years ago.<br><br>—But three years ago, the Head of House still didn't want me, right?<br><br>Raon tilted his head.<br><br>-Forget it. It's not worth explaining…<br><br>Wrath waved his hand as if it wasn't worth talking about.<br><br>-How can you be so clueless that way? Are you really human…?<br><br>* * *<br><br>A thunderous roar echoed as a lightning bolt shot towards the sky after Raon’s sword strike, turning into a red thunderbolt as it fell. That magnificent light, brighter than the rising sun, split the earth. With a deafening boom, the intense flash created a blackened crater on the ground. The depth of the hole seemed unfathomable, as if it had been created by a power that was beyond human capabilities.<br><br>Raon lowered the Heavenly Drive, which was still crackling with lightning, and let out a small chuckle.<br><br>"It's certainly different."<br><br>Glenn had said he created the Thunder Piercing Heaven by mixing the forms of the Azure Sky Sword and the Heavenly Thunder Arts, but using it himself, Raon felt it was different from both.<br><br>‘Should I say it combines only the advantages of the two sword techniques?’<br><br>The path of the sword seemed to embody both the grandeur of the Azure Sky Sword and the sharp offensive power of the Heavenly Thunder Arts. The Thunder Piercing Heaven seemed to be a Supreme Martial Art that only those who had reached the highest levels of Transcendence could create.<br><br>«Of course, it has the disadvantage of a slow activation time.»<br><br>As each had different strengths and weaknesses, it seemed the three sword techniques could be used in different situations.<br><br>‘I should also be able to improve my proficiency in the Blade Sword, Spear Sword, Long Sword, and Thunder Sword.’<br><br>Thanks to the Thunder Piercing Heaven, he felt he could supplement his lacking sword techniques. It was a martial art that could be useful in many ways.<br><br>"Mmm…"<br><br>Glenn nodded calmly as he looked at the crater Raon had created.<br><br>"To have such power despite my blocking it with my aura, you certainly learn fast."<br><br>He briefly licked his lips as if he felt proud and regretful at the same time.<br><br>"There's a lack of fluidity in the forms, but you should be able to practice on your own."<br><br>Glenn sheathed his Heavenly Tremor as if there was nothing more to teach.<br><br>"It's all thanks to your excellent teaching, Grandpa."<br><br>Raon smiled slightly and said it was thanks to Glenn.<br><br>"Ahem! It's nothing."<br><br>Glenn waved his hand as if it wasn't worth mentioning. Seeing his face turn red like an autumn apple, he seemed to be in a good mood.<br><br>"So, when will you enter the Room of Self?"<br><br>He tilted his chin as if to say he would make the preparations when Raon told him.<br><br>"I'd like to enter right now."<br><br>Raon nodded as he wiped away the remaining lightning from the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>-This king doesn't want to enter right now!<br><br>Wrath shook his head vigorously, saying there were still many things he wanted to eat.<br><br>-I've heard about it before. It's a place with a different space-time axis! If you enter without preparation, both you and I will suffer!<br><br>He shouted that it would be tough to endure and to think carefully.<br><br>‘I’ve already prepared myself.’<br><br>Raon pushed Wrath aside and waited for Glenn’s response.<br><br>"Immediately…"<br><br>Glenn stroked his chin and shook his head slightly.<br><br>"I understand how you feel, but the Room of Self is completely different from the training room you're thinking of. Time and space are different, so it's better to prepare well before you go."<br><br>He shook his head, telling Raon not to move too hastily.<br><br>"You must still be fatigued from the battle, so enter in a week."<br><br>"I'll do as you say, Grandpa."<br><br>Raon immediately bowed his head without the slightest objection.<br><br>-Eh?<br><br>Wrath opened his eyes in disbelief.<br><br>-This king said the same thing! You don't listen to me when I say it, but you listen to that old man!<br><br>He raised his fist and said this was discrimination.<br><br>"Thank you for your understanding. See you in a week."<br><br>Glenn told Raon to go to the main building and left the clearing at the foot of North Grave Mountain.<br><br>-Hey! Don't ignore me!<br><br>Wrath pounded his shoulder with his chubby fist, telling Raon to look at him.<br><br>-This king is a king in Devildom! I have a higher rank than that old man!<br><br>He threw punches repeatedly, demanding to be treated like a demon king.<br><br>-Alright, calm down.<br><br>-How can this king calm down! Before my eyes, such discrimination…<br><br>‘We have a week now, so I can eat whatever you want.’<br><br>-Alright then!<br><br>Wrath nodded as if he had never been angry.<br><br>"...You're amazing."<br><br>Raon had planned to eat Wrath’s favorite foods anyway, but he hadn't expected his anger to subside so quickly. Truly an amazing demon king. Raon patted Wrath’s head, who had become cheerful again, and returned to the annex building.<br><br>As the sun had been up for a while, smoke was rising from the chimney, and delicious smells wafted from the kitchen.<br><br>-It's the perfect time! We can have breakfast and then go eat bead ice cream right away!<br><br>Wrath grinned, seeming to be in a good mood from the smell of food.<br><br>-That doesn't sound bad.<br><br>Raon nodded and opened the door to the annex building. Olga, who seemed to have washed her face because it was still damp, stopped short at the sight of him.<br><br>"Seeing her awake, I feel even more reassured."<br><br>She's completely different. Originally, Olga's skin was covered in black lines like tattoos due to her sacred power, making her look as if her whole body was tattooed. But after experiencing the Complete Body Reformation, she now had milk-white skin, like that of a newborn baby.<br><br>It felt like she had transformed from a villainess exuding a desolate atmosphere to a saint emanating a bright and warm energy.<br><br>"You look like a real saint now. It suits you very well."<br><br>"Mmm…"<br><br>Olga blinked as if she was dazed and took a step back.<br><br>"You've been training again! You can't stay still for a moment!"<br><br>Sylvia, who came out from behind Olga, shook her head as if she was exasperated. She slightly turned her gaze and gave Olga a meaningful look, as if telling her to do something.<br><br>"Ah!"<br><br>Olga seemed to regain her senses and straightened her posture before bowing her head to Raon.<br><br>"Thank you. The truth is, I didn't believe it much, but I never thought you would change me this much. I truly thank you."<br><br>She bowed even lower and said thank you twice.<br><br>"Only with words?"<br><br>Raon nodded, looking at the top of Sylvia’s head.<br><br>"Eh, eh?"<br><br>Olga's lips trembled as if she was nervous.<br><br>"I used quite a lot to cure you. To begin with, two of the highest-grade elixirs were used."<br><br>"But, the Head of House gave those…"<br><br>"He didn't simply give them to me. I obtained them because I spoke well."<br><br>Raon shook his head vigorously, saying it definitely wasn't free.<br><br>"I also spent all my aura and haven't recovered yet, and poured out all my mental energy, so I still have a headache. I feel like I fought another war with the Black Tower."<br><br>"Mmm…"<br><br>As Raon spoke, Olga seemed to shrink, her shoulders narrowing to the size of her palms. She looked at Sylvia with trembling eyes.<br><br>Gulp<br><br>Sylvia's chin trembled as if she hadn't expected Raon to say those things. She quickly turned her back to avoid Olga’s gaze.<br><br>"Then, what should I do…?"<br><br>Olga let out a deep sigh as if she realized she couldn't repay the debt no matter what she did.<br><br>"What should you do? First, learn to dance and sing. I like music. When I'm bored, you can perform and sing for me. Ah, how about cooking? If you don't know, learn. You'll have a lot to do later on."<br><br>Raon chuckled as he listed things Olga would probably never do.<br><br>"Ugh…"<br><br>Olga inhaled deeply as if she was imagining a hellish future ahead.<br><br>"Fine! Yes! Go ahead! I'll do it all! Singing, dancing, whatever! I'll do it all for you, bastard!"<br><br>She shouted that she would do it properly, kicking the ground. It seemed she had returned to her original temperament.<br><br>"That's all."<br><br>Raon chuckled and lightly tapped Olga’s head with his finger.<br><br>"It was boring when the person who curses and criticizes as naturally as breathing was quiet. Let's go back to how we were before."<br><br>He lowered his hand and said that would be enough.<br><br>"That's all?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>From the beginning, he hadn't intended to ask anything from Olga in return. He only wished that she, who had dedicated her life to others, would live a little happier. Besides, even if he didn't want it, Olga would surely step forward when Zieghart, no, the continent faced danger, so there was no need for other requests.<br><br>-If you understand, let's eat.<br><br>Raon said this and entered the dining room.<br><br>—I told you! Our son doesn't ask for anything in return for things like this.<br><br>Sylvia put her hand on Olga’s shoulder, laughing with an "Ehehe".<br><br>—But before, you didn't seem to believe it, did you?<br><br>Olga looked at Sylvia with piercing eyes.<br><br>"W-what are you talking about?!"<br><br>Sylvia jumped as if she had been caught stealing.<br><br>"You avoided my eyes."<br><br>—No, I didn't? You must be imagining things?<br><br>"But…"<br><br>"Oh? Helen? Do you need my help too?"<br><br>She rushed to the dining room, calling out to Helen, whom they hadn't even mentioned.<br><br>"Haha…"<br><br>Olga walked towards the dining room where Sylvia and Raon had entered, a bright smile on her face.<br><br>"Like mother, like son."<br><br>How enviable!<br><br>* * *<br><br>After finishing breakfast, Raon stood in front of the entrance.<br><br>-Hurry up and go! We have to eat bead ice cream before this pleasant feeling of fullness is gone!<br><br>Wrath patted his back, saying the start of the day should be perfect.<br><br>-Alright, stop insisting.<br><br>Raon pushed Wrath aside and turned around.<br><br>"Sister."<br><br>He gestured towards Sia, who was wearing a white hat.<br><br>"If you're ready, let's go."<br><br>He had promised to take Sia to the bead ice cream shop, partly to fulfill his promise to spend time with her.<br><br>"Okay!"<br><br>Sia nodded with a bright face, as if she was excited to go out with her brother.<br><br>"Let's go!"<br><br>Sia pressed her hat down with her hands and stuck to Raon’s side.<br><br>"You look pretty today."<br><br>Raon patted Sia’s head gently and then went out into the annex garden. As he was about to walk towards the bustling area, he saw two people approaching from the direction of the main building. The man on the right was Karoon, the Master of the Central Martial Palace, and the man on the left was Balder, the True Master of the Martial Palace.<br><br>‘Why are those two coming together?’<br><br>Although he found it strange, Raon approached Karoon and Balder and bowed his head.<br><br>"Greetings, Palace Masters."<br><br>"Hi!"<br><br>Sia also bowed her head to the two men, following Raon’s lead.<br><br>—Don't bother with those formalities! Not amongst ourselves!<br><br>Balder shook his head emphatically and said that's not how a family should act.<br><br>"Sorry for arriving so early."<br><br>Karoon waved his hand as if apologizing for the intrusion, even as he accepted their greeting.<br><br>-No problem, but what brings you here?<br><br>Raon tilted his head and looked at Karoon and Balder. He was curious about their intentions, as there was no reason for them to come there.<br><br>"Well…"<br><br>"Ahem!"<br><br>Karoon and Balder remained silent, as if checking each other's reactions.<br><br>-Raon! Let's go quickly!<br><br>Seeing that Karoon and Balder weren't speaking, Sia tugged on Raon’s sleeve, apparently thinking she had nothing to do with them.<br><br>-¡Your sister's right! It seems they have nothing to say, so ignore them!<br><br>Wrath also added strength to Sia’s hand, telling Raon to leave them alone.<br><br>"Wait a moment, Sister. It seems the two of them have something to say."<br><br>Raon pushed Wrath and Sia aside, looking at Karoon and Balder.<br><br>-Then! Let's go together!<br><br>Sia wiggled her finger, suggesting they talk while eating bead ice cream.<br><br>"Hmm… I wonder if that would work?"<br><br>After briefly licking his lips, Raon looked at Karoon and Balder.<br><br>"Let's go eat bead ice cream…"<br><br>Raon slightly extended his hand towards Karoon and Balder, who seemed uncomfortable.<br><br>"Would you like to join us?"</p>
