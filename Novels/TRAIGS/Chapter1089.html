        <p>"Huh...?"<br><br>Raon's jaw dropped as he stared at the Blade Queen and Warlord kneeling before him.<br><br>'They're saying I'm the Sword and Saber Sovereign's successor?'<br><br>While it was true that he had received the earth aura from the Sword and Saber Sovereign, he had never once thought of himself as his successor. He had only tried to use it after seeing a new way to utilize the earth aura during the Blade Queen and Warlord's battle, but he never expected this situation to unfold.<br><br>'This is ridiculous...'<br><br>Though he had suspected that the Blade Queen and Warlord might be connected to the Sword and Saber Sovereign and had stayed here to confirm it, he never imagined they would react like this so quickly.<br><br>-W-what? What's going on now!<br><br>Wrath's lips trembled.<br><br>-Why do they seem less like suckers and more like slaves now!<br><br>He pounded his chest hard as if sensing something ominous.<br><br>"Please calm down, everyone."<br><br>Raon lowered his outstretched palm slightly.<br><br>"Oh successor!"<br><br>"It is an honor to meet the Sword and Saber Sovereign's successor."<br><br>The Blade Queen and Warlord raised their trembling hands to grasp their own wrists. The madness flowing in their eyes suggested they had no intention of listening.<br><br>"W-wait a moment!"<br><br>Raon firmly pushed away their hands.<br><br>"While it's true that I'm learning the Sword and Saber Sovereign's martial arts, I'm not his successor or heir!"<br><br>He leaned back as he explained that he only knew the Sword and Saber Sovereign's martial arts.<br><br>"The martial arts you're learning! That firm, heavy aura is proof that you're the successor!"<br><br>The Blade Queen nodded emphatically as if that aura was enough proof.<br><br>"It's an aura that no one else could possibly use or even understand!"<br><br>She gripped her hands tighter, convinced of her assertion.<br><br>"The earth aura is rare."<br><br>The Warlord's cold eyes began to burn with intensity.<br><br>"Compared to the brilliant and powerful fire, free-flowing and gentle water, or swift and sharp wind, earth is less popular, with almost no transcendent aura cultivation methods. We cannot be mistaken about this."<br><br>He stroked his chin, certain that what Raon was learning was undoubtedly the Sword and Saber Sovereign's symbolic aura.<br><br>"But I don't even know the name of this aura cultivation method..."<br><br>Raon waved both hands and gave a hollow laugh.<br><br>'Because he disappeared before telling me the name.'<br><br>The Sword and Saber Sovereign had vanished right after passing on only the earth aura, the Devil-Fighting Sword Art, and the true meaning of the Devil-Cutting Blade Art, so Raon still didn't even know the name of the aura cultivation method.<br><br>"That aura is called the Diamond Earth Technique. While we can only learn half of it each and use it to support other auras, you as the successor should be able to wield its power directly."<br><br>He nodded, explaining that the Diamond Earth Technique could both support other auras and be used independently.<br><br>"Huh..."<br><br>Raon smacked his lips as he felt the Diamond Earth Technique's energy stirring in his middle dantian.<br><br>'Was this martial art really that amazing?'<br><br>No, he knew it was an amazing martial art, but he hadn't known about this way of using it. He felt somewhat regretful that he hadn't spent more time on it, having focused on the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation and Glacier instead.<br><br>"Don't worry!"<br><br>The Blade Queen smiled knowingly, as if she could read Raon's thoughts.<br><br>"We'll help you master the Diamond Earth Technique quickly."<br><br>She clasped her hands together, confident they could raise his proficiency quickly.<br><br>"That's right. Though we each only know half, we've both lived our entire lives with the Diamond Earth Technique."<br><br>The Warlord nodded cheerfully, telling him not to worry. Raon hadn't expected such a warm expression from this cold man.<br><br>"Are you both also successors of the Sword and Saber Sovereign?"<br><br>Raon asked, looking at the Blade Queen and Warlord in turn.<br><br>"Not yet."<br><br>The Warlord shook his head.<br><br>"We can only be recognized as true successors of the Sword and Saber Sovereign by defeating our opponent and obtaining the other half of the Diamond Earth Technique and weapon."<br><br>He let out a short breath, explaining that he couldn't become the Sword and Saber Sovereign's successor yet because he hadn't defeated the Blade Queen.<br><br>"He's right,"<br><br>The Blade Queen tilted her chin toward her husband, the Warlord.<br><br>"As I mentioned earlier, our duel has been continuing for a thousand years."<br><br>She dusted off her hands, explaining that no conclusion had been reached because the martial arts and successors had been evenly matched.<br><br>"However, that long era ends now. Since someone who has mastered the complete Diamond Earth Technique has appeared, we will follow you."<br><br>The Warlord knelt again, declaring his acceptance of Raon.<br><br>"Honestly, if some weird guy had been the successor, we would have cut his head off right away..."<br><br>The Blade Queen's eyes flashed dangerously before settling.<br><br>"But as the Sword Emperor of Zieghart, we have no choice but to acknowledge you."<br><br>She nodded, indicating that accepting Raon was only natural.<br><br>"...I see."<br><br>Raon let out a short sigh as he looked at the expectant eyes of the Blade Queen and Warlord.<br><br>'Come to think of it...'<br><br>The Sword and Saber Sovereign had mentioned having disciples who were taught swordsmanship and sword techniques separately. <br><br>He had said that since there were successors who inherited his sword and way, Raon should find them and make them his people. <br><br>He had thought they would have naturally disappeared or been forgotten after such a long time, but he hadn't expected them to continue for a thousand years.<br><br>'And as the Blade Queen and Warlord, no less.'<br><br>Without a massive organization like Zieghart, martial arts and treasures would inevitably be lost over time. However, it seemed those two schools had passed down almost perfect martial arts to their successors.<br><br>"Our mission is to find the Sword and Saber Sovereign's true successor. Originally, the two of us were supposed to fight to the death to achieve this, but since you've appeared on your own, Lord Raon, following you is only natural."<br><br>The Warlord bowed his head, pledging to serve as a successor of the way school.<br><br>"Honestly, after becoming husband and wife, neither of us could fight at full strength, so this worked out better."<br><br>The Blade Queen sighed, saying she had been torn between her love for the Warlord and her sect's mission.<br><br>"I too will follow Lord Raon."<br><br>She smiled brightly with a relieved expression.<br><br>"However, to become the Sword and Saber Sovereign's true successor, Lord Raon must master not only the Diamond Earth Technique, but also the Devil-Fighting Sword Art and Devil-Cutting Blade Art that we practice."<br><br>The Warlord nodded, saying that one must master these three martial arts at intermediate level or higher to become the Sword and Saber Sovereign's true successor.<br><br>"Actually, although the Devil-Fighting Sword Art and Devil-Cutting Blade Art have been somewhat lost, we should be able to restore them quickly by combining our knowledge."<br><br>The Blade Queen clenched her fist, asking them to leave that part to her and the Warlord.<br><br>"About the Devil-Fighting Sword Art and Devil-Cutting Blade Art you mentioned..."<br><br>Raon raised his hand as he swallowed dryly.<br><br>"I actually know them all. The complete, undiminished versions..."<br><br>The Sword and Saber Sovereign had passed on not only the Diamond Earth Technique but also the original versions of the Devil-Fighting Sword Art and Devil-Cutting Blade Art, so they were all still fresh in his mind.<br><br>"Ah!"<br><br>"As expected!"<br><br>The Blade Queen and Warlord's eyes flashed with intense blue light again.<br><br>"The true successor of the Sword and Saber Sovereign!"<br><br>The two knelt and bowed their heads again, as if returning to fifteen minutes ago.<br><br>-Ahh...<br><br>Wrath ground his teeth as he watched the excited eyes of the Blade Queen and Warlord.<br><br>-Why are there so many suckers in this world! And why do they all flock to this guy! Come to me instead!<br><br>He grabbed his head and shook it, lamenting the unfairness of the world.<br><br>'Sorry, but...'<br><br>Raon slightly turned his head as he listened to Wrath's wailing.<br><br>'There's no bigger sucker in the world than you.'<br><br>***<br><br>"Phew..."<br><br>Dorian raised the thick blanket with trembling hands to completely cover Sloth's face.<br><br>"So, did it work out well?"<br><br>He swallowed nervously as he looked behind him.<br><br>"It seems so."<br><br>Evelyn nodded as she watched the Blade Queen and Warlord kneeling before Raon.<br><br>"Huh...?"<br><br>Dorian's chin trembled.<br><br>"Who are those two people kneeling before the Palace Master? Criminals?"<br><br>"The Blade Queen and Warlord."<br><br>"Ah, the Blade Queen and Warlord. I thought they were criminals who had fled here... Gasp!"<br><br>He had been nodding calmly before jumping up in surprise. Thud. However, afraid of waking Sloth, he landed on his tiptoes to minimize the sound and impact.<br><br>"T-the Blade Queen and Warlord? Why are they here?"<br><br>Dorian's jaw dropped in complete bewilderment.<br><br>"I'm not sure either. They're calling Raon the Sword and Saber Sovereign's successor and asking to serve him?"<br><br>Evelyn smiled sweetly as if she had been listening to everything.<br><br>"The S-Sword and Saber Sovereign? Then were the Blade Queen and Warlord his successors?"<br><br>Dorian nodded as if understanding somewhat, since he had entered Zieghart's training ground with Raon.<br><br>"That's right. The martial arts obtained from that training ground seem to have helped."<br><br>Evelyn drew a subtle smile, confirming this was correct.<br><br>"Um, excuse me..."<br><br>Dorian blinked as he looked at Evelyn.<br><br>"Only our Light Wind Palace should know about that, so how...?"<br><br>"Because it's about Raon."<br><br>Evelyn lowered her eyebrows calmly, saying it was only natural she knew everything since it concerned Raon.<br><br>"Ah, aha! I see."<br><br>Dorian nodded, his eyes trembling.<br><br>'S-scary...'<br><br>A chilling sensation like his chest and stomach were melting swept over him. With the Demon King of Sloth sleeping behind him and the world's greatest stalker grinning in front of him, he felt suffocated.<br><br>'Palace Master, please come quickly. Or call me over there!'<br><br>Sniffling, he looked at the dimension Evelyn had opened.<br><br>"Ah!"<br><br>Dorian clapped his hands as he observed Raon through the dimension.<br><br>"If he's really accepting the Warlord and Blade Queen as subordinates, how many Golden Tablets should he receive?"<br><br>Though they would be under Raon rather than Zieghart directly, returning to Zieghart with those two Transcendents would be an achievement beyond measure in terms of Golden Tablets. He wondered how many Golden Tablets Glenn would give Raon.<br><br>"The Palace Master wasn't interested in Golden Tablets, but this is really lucky."<br><br>Dorian laughed softly, saying it was amazing.<br><br>"It's not luck, but something achieved through determined action."<br><br>Evelyn shook her head firmly.<br><br>"What? What do you...?"<br><br>"Raon's willpower and desire to save Zieghart created this situation."<br><br>She looked at Raon with trembling eyes, saying it wasn't mere luck.<br><br>"Um..."<br><br>Dorian stared at Evelyn's back for a while before speaking.<br><br>"Why do you like Lord Raon so much, Lady Evelyn?"<br><br>"Because he's Raon."<br><br>Evelyn answered immediately without any hesitation, as if that was reason enough.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>Dorian let out a soft exclamation and smiled gently.<br><br>"Why are you smiling?"<br><br>"Because I feel the same way."<br><br>Dorian nodded peacefully for the first time.<br><br>"I also follow him because he's Lord Raon."<br><br>"I see."<br><br>Evelyn closed and opened her eyes in understanding. For the first time, the two watched Raon through the dimension with similar expressions.<br><br>***<br><br>"The Diamond Earth Technique, and the Devil-Fighting Sword Art and Devil-Cutting Blade Art as well..."<br><br>The Blade Queen nodded briefly as she examined Raon.<br><br>"They're all at beginner level, but that's fine. You have the best teachers right here!"<br><br>She pointed at herself with her thumb, saying she would take care of everything.<br><br>"It seems you can master the Diamond Earth Technique on your own."<br><br>The Warlord nodded as he sensed the firmness of the Diamond Earth Technique settled in Raon's middle dantian.<br><br>"However, since the Devil-Cutting Blade Art and Devil-Fighting Sword Art are different from ordinary martial arts, even you as the successor will find them difficult to master. Still, we'll do our best."<br><br>He bowed his head, promising to help minimize those difficulties.<br><br>"Um..."<br><br>Raon slightly lowered his eyebrows as he looked at the Blade Queen and Warlord.<br><br>"Are you two the only ones in the sword school and blade school?"<br><br>"That's right. They're single-succession sects."<br><br>The Blade Queen nodded.<br><br>"If it weren't so, I couldn't have married him. I would have been expelled from the sect and it would have been a mess."<br><br>She smiled, saying she was able to marry the Warlord because she was alone in her sect.<br><br>"The same goes for me. Single succession."<br><br>The Warlord also nodded, saying he was alone in his sect.<br><br>"Ah! Though not a subordinate, that one over there is in the same boat as us."<br><br>The Blade Queen pointed at the Gold Dragon standing there absentmindedly.<br><br>[M-me too? I have nothing to do with the Sword and Saber Sovereign...]<br><br>The Gold Dragon widened its eyes in confusion.<br><br>"You are involved with us."<br><br>"Are you going to break your dragon's oath?"<br><br>The Warlord and Blade Queen frowned as they looked at the Gold Dragon.<br><br>[Ah, really...]<br><br>The Gold Dragon dipped its head into the North Sea as if resigned. Bubbles rose continuously from the cold water. Who knew such a massive dragon could look cute?<br><br>-What a sucker! Maybe I should roast and eat it!<br><br>Wrath frowned in displeasure.<br><br>"Isn't two Transcendents and one Ancient Dragon enough?"<br><br>The Blade Queen smiled, saying that would be more than enough anywhere.<br><br>"Yes. It's more than I deserve."<br><br>Raon nodded while letting out a breath.<br><br>"As befitting such a generous gift, mastering the Sword and Saber Sovereign's martial arts won't be easy. It will take two years to make us truly follow you."<br><br>The Warlord's eyes dimmed as he said that much time would be needed even with him and the Blade Queen teaching.<br><br>"Two years...?"<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes deeply.<br><br>'For gaining the Blade Queen, Warlord, and an Ancient Dragon, that's practically nothing. However...'<br><br>He didn't have that kind of time.<br><br>Given that Derus could appear at any time, he couldn't spend two years training here.<br><br>"Would you show me a demonstration first?"<br><br>Raon placed his hand on the Heavenly Drive as he looked at the Blade Queen and Warlord.<br><br>"Then I'll show you the sword techniques you're familiar with."<br><br>The Blade Queen stepped forward with a smile.<br><br>"The martial art I've mastered is the Devil-Cutting Blade Art. It's a swordsmanship that burns demons with powerful flames."<br><br>She extended her sword into the air, declaring she would cut demons. Surging flames heated the northern air to a deep red. Whoosh! The Blade Queen's Devil-Cutting Blade Art was so powerful and sharp it seemed more like a blade technique than swordsmanship.<br><br>It utilized both thrusts and slashes, a transcendent swordsmanship imbued with extreme power, speed, brilliance, and spirit.<br><br>"How was that?"<br><br>The Blade Queen stepped back after demonstrating all the forms she could perform.<br><br>"It was a feast for the eyes."<br><br>Raon applauded as he gave his honest impression to the Blade Queen.<br><br>"You can do it too, Lord Raon. If you work hard, we might finish in a year and a half instead of two years?"<br><br>The Blade Queen waved her hand, saying they could shorten it by half a year.<br><br>"That's still too long for me."<br><br>Raon smacked his lips briefly and stepped forward before the Blade Queen and Warlord. Shing! He drew the Heavenly Drive, bent his knees, and performed the exact Devil-Cutting Blade Art the Blade Queen had just demonstrated. Whoosh!<br><br>Though slower, weaker, and less spectacular than the Blade Queen's version, his sword followed the exact flow and willpower that the Devil-Cutting Blade Art should have, even reproducing the forms said to have been lost.<br><br>Slash! As the flames from the beginning and end of the Devil-Cutting Blade Art connected, a long, straight red line appeared in the northern sky.<br><br>"Wow!"<br><br>"Insane..."<br><br>The Blade Queen and Warlord's jaws trembled, apparently never imagining he could replicate it immediately.<br><br>"Not a year and a half..."<br><br>Raon raised his index finger toward the stunned Blade Queen and Warlord.<br><br>"Let's make it one month."</p>
