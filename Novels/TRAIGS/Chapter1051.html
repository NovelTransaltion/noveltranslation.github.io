        <p>-Hurrrggh!<br><br>Wrath let out an exclamation that was more like a scream when he saw the ancient Kraken being dragged onto land.<br><br>-W-why is an octopus coming out of a jar!<br><br>Despite witnessing the magic, he shook his fist in incomprehension.<br><br>"W-what is this...?"<br><br>Balder blinked as he approached.<br><br>"Why is the Kraken inside a jar!"<br><br>Like Wrath, he couldn't understand the situation, his jaw trembling.<br><br>"Is that really a Kraken? It's even bigger than an Ancient Dragon?"<br><br>"I heard it was carrying the White Blood Religion Headquarters, but why did it come out of a jar?"<br><br>"Did they summon the Kraken with a jar? At this level, isn't it divine power rather than magic?"<br><br>The other swordsmen also couldn't close their mouths, seemingly bewildered by the Kraken emerging from the jar.<br><br>"There are many ways to catch an octopus, but the oldest and most convenient method is jar fishing."<br><br>Raon lowered his hand as he watched the Kraken writhing with its mountain-sized tentacles.<br><br>"Jar fishing...?"<br><br>Runaan tilted her head, wondering what that meant.<br><br>"It's a fishing method where you throw jars tied with ropes into the sea like a net, then collect them the next morning. The jars will be full of octopuses that were active during the night."<br><br>Raon pointed to the broken jar that had contained the Kraken.<br><br>"W-why is that possible? There isn't even any bait in the jars..."<br><br>Krein took a deep breath, unable to comprehend.<br><br>"Cephalopods like octopuses have a habit of curling up and hiding in dark places. Jars are perfect for that."<br><br>He smiled as he explained that this observation led to the creation of jar fishing.<br><br>"That Kraken is a real monster from mythology. As massive and powerful as it is, its instincts are equally strong. Evelyn and the Archmages prepared three spells targeting that."<br><br>Raon held up three fingers.<br><br>"First was summoning a jar large enough for the Kraken to enter."<br><br>He looked at Evelyn, who had summoned that enormous jar in precisely the right position without even the slightest error.<br><br>"Second was casting a spell to enhance its instincts so the Kraken would ignore the White Blood Religion's commands."<br><br>He pointed to Larian, who had created a new spell that only enhanced instincts without any offensive intent.<br><br>"Ah, so that's why..."<br><br>"Yes. The Kraken forgot about protecting the White Blood Religion Headquarters and, following its instincts, entered the jar Evelyn summoned. Finally..."<br><br>Raon looked at Chamber, who was breathing heavily as if exhausted.<br><br>"Chamber used spatial magic to summon here the jar containing both the Kraken and the White Blood Religion Headquarters."<br><br>"It wasn't that impressive."<br><br>Chamber waved her hand, saying it was nothing compared to what Evelyn and Larian did.<br><br>"It was indeed impressive."<br><br>Raon firmly shook his head as he looked at Chamber.<br><br>'It was an absolutely incredible feat.'<br><br>Because the White Blood Religion's Leader was quick-witted, no magic could be cast on the jar. That's why Chamber had to instantly transport that massive jar and the Kraken while only receiving mana support from a distance. Among the three Archmages, she had to expend the most mana and mental energy.<br><br>Even though spatial magic was her specialty, it must have consumed an enormous amount of mental energy.<br><br>"I see..."<br><br>Balder let out a long breath, finally understanding the situation.<br><br>"Now I understand why it took two months and why they couldn't tell us about it."<br><br>He looked at the magicians preparing new spells with an unusually serious expression.<br><br>"Those two are something else, aren't they?"<br><br>Alice raised her thumbs up to Chamber and Larian.<br><br>"You did well too."<br><br>She smiled at Evelyn, whose eyes were sparkling.<br><br>"Aunt!"<br><br>Evelyn hugged Alice, saying she was happy to see her again.<br><br>"Oof..."<br><br>Alice blinked in surprise at Evelyn's sudden hug. Evelyn's forcefulness and energy seemed unmatched across the continent.<br><br>"As expected of the Five Kings' magicians!"<br><br>"Knowing they're behind us gives me strength."<br><br>"Yeah. It doesn't feel like we'll lose today."<br><br>The swordsmen clenched their fists, vowing to fight in a way worthy of the magicians' support.<br><br>"How did you figure it out?"<br><br>Larian tilted her head as she looked at Raon.<br><br>"Did Evelyn tell you?"<br><br>"I didn't say anything!"<br><br>Evelyn vigorously waved her hands, insisting she hadn't explained anything.<br><br>"No, you did."<br><br>Raon gave a faint smile as he looked at Evelyn.<br><br>"I did? When?"<br><br>"You gave me a hint when we saw the Kraken underwater for the second time."<br><br>Because Evelyn had mentioned cephalopods and instincts while looking at the Kraken, he had been able to envision today's scene before the magic was even complete.<br><br>"That's Raon for you. I had no idea you'd catch on from just that..."<br><br>Evelyn's eyes widened in surprise that he had grasped the entire picture.<br><br>"You figured it out from those words? You really are something else... ugh!"<br><br>Chamber clicked her tongue as if wondering what kind of person he was, then doubled over.<br><br>"Are you alright?"<br><br>Raon rushed to support Chamber's shoulders.<br><br>“You’re injured, so don’t push yourself too hard.”<br><br>Chamber shook her head, saying it was the aftereffects of using consecutive large-scale spells while her upper dantian hadn't fully recovered.<br><br>"You used multiple large-scale spells in succession?"<br><br>"I cast chaos magic to immobilize the Kraken. Its mana resistance was fierce, so it was quite challenging."<br><br>It seemed she had cast chaos magic to immobilize it immediately after summoning the Kraken. Now her pale complexion made sense.<br><br>"This is as far as I go."<br><br>Chamber took out a lollipop and bit it with her teeth.<br><br>"I can only help with movement and support now, so I'll leave the rest to you."<br><br>She smiled faintly, telling them to draw out the White Blood Religion's Leader from that white city.<br><br>"And..."<br><br>Chamber pulled forward one of the magicians who had been standing behind her.<br><br>"This one will be Balkar's commander here."<br><br>She curled her lips as she pulled back the hood of the magician she had brought forward.<br><br>"You're doing this again..."<br><br>Jayna. The princess of Balkar was here as well.<br><br>'I had no idea.'<br><br>The mana flow was deep and calm, so while he had thought it was Chamber's favored disciple, he hadn't expected it to be Jayna.<br><br>-That arrogant girl. She's become a monster.<br><br>'Indeed. She gives off the presence of a true powerhouse now.'<br><br>Jayna was emanating the aura of importance not from her birthright as a princess, but from the power she had earned herself. She really had changed a lot.<br><br>"Please let me know if you need anything."<br><br>Unlike before, Jayna bowed her head while looking at him with unwavering eyes.<br><br>"I'll be counting on you."<br><br>Raon spoke respectfully, sensing the change in Jayna's soul.<br><br>"Then I'll trust you."<br><br>Chamber waved to herself and Jayna before entering a blue Dimensional Gate. Without even taking time to rest, she would return to Balkar headquarters to prepare paths for movement across the entire Continent.<br><br>"Aren't we talking too much?"<br><br>Balder approached while rotating his boulder-like shoulders.<br><br>"We need to strike before they come to their senses!"<br><br>He raised his clenched fist as if urging for the attack order to be given.<br><br>"I think the same."<br><br>Void Sword Division Leader Serena frowned as she looked at the walls of the White Blood Religion Headquarters.<br><br>"More and more Blood Demons are climbing up the walls."<br><br>"Do you see that?"<br><br>Raon pointed at the White Fog spreading around the White Blood Religion Headquarters.<br><br>"That fog not only has strong resistance to aura and magic, but it also acts as a formation that makes you lose your way and see illusions. If we go in without a plan, we'll end up fighting each other and be annihilated."<br><br>"T-then how..."<br><br>"There's someone else who can handle that."<br><br>Though he could disperse the fog by fully unleashing the Azure Sky Sword imbued with heavenly energy, that wasn't his role.<br><br>"Evelyn."<br><br>This was a task for the genius magician who had observed that fog with him since they were underwater.<br><br>"It's done!"<br><br>Evelyn clasped her hands as if in prayer. As she quickly moved her lips to chant an ancient spell, the darkening sky trembled and dropped a brilliant yellow lightning bolt.<br><br>An enormous wave of power that seemed to split heaven and earth erupted, the sea trembled as if about to overflow, and the White Fog covering the White Blood Religion Headquarters was erased.<br><br>"How's that? This is me! Your woman!"<br><br>Evelyn smiled brightly as if asking for approval. However, contrary to her smile, her eyelids were trembling. She seemed to have overexerted herself considerably.<br><br>"You can go now."<br><br>Evelyn raised her hand, saying only the protective magic on the walls and city remained.<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>Raon nodded heavily and steadied Evelyn's shaking shoulders.<br><br>"Oh my? Right here in front of everyone?"<br><br>Evelyn casually lowered her collar as if asking if he was serious.<br><br>"..."<br><br>-That mad woman is no good. Her score shoots up only to plummet straight down!<br><br>Wrath heaved a weary sigh, saying he was getting tired of this.<br><br>"Listen, everyone."<br><br>Raon turned around, ignoring the blushing Evelyn.<br><br>"With all your might, overcome those white walls. No, overcome that castle of corpses built with the blood of innocent people."<br><br>He drew his Heavenly Drive toward the White Blood Religion Headquarters, which reeked of blood even with just the fog cleared.<br><br>"We receive your command!"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen drew their swords at Raon's words. Though countless swordsmen performed their Drawing Technique simultaneously, only a single sound was heard.<br><br>"We'll take the second bridge."<br><br>Balder showed his white teeth as he shouldered his gleaming Flexible Sword.<br><br>"The Zieghart assault team has always been the True Martial Palace! Don't lose to the Light Wind Palace!"<br><br>He raised his chin while stomping his foot hard enough to make the beach tremble.<br><br>"Then I'll take the third bridge?"<br><br>Alice smiled brightly as she looked back at Lawaine and the Azure Wind's crew.<br><br>"We meet after so long, and it's straight to war. But that's just like us, isn't it?"<br><br>She flashed a refreshing smile as vast as the sea, as if telling them to follow well.<br><br>"We'll take the fourth position."<br><br>Void Sword Division Leader Serena and Vanguard Sword Squad Leader Latein nodded as they looked at the fourth bridge.<br><br>"Then the last one..."<br><br>"Leave that one."<br><br>Larian shook her head as if saying to leave it be. The fifth bridge seemed to be reserved for Owen's knights who would arrive later.<br><br>"So it's a siege battle after all."<br><br>Krein stretched his fingers as he shook off his tension.<br><br>"Look on the bright side. It's better than a siege battle at sea, right?"<br><br>Raon smiled faintly as he gripped Krein's shoulder.<br><br>"O-of course! It's just that we practiced fighting in water so much, it's a shame we can't show it off!"<br><br>Krein shook his head vigorously, insisting he wasn't complaining.<br><br>"Then let's begin immediately. They probably haven't organized themselves yet..."<br><br>Just as Raon was about to give the attack order...Countless Blood Demons began climbing up the White Blood Religion's walls. They gripped their swords tightly while continuously filling the walls, as if building a barrier with their own bodies.<br><br>'This is the problem...'<br><br>Raon frowned as he watched the growing number of Blood Demons.<br><br>'Overwhelming numbers.'<br><br>As expected of a long-running cult, the White Blood Religion boasted the largest numbers among the Five Demons. It was disgusting to watch, knowing they could afford to use their followers as meat shields just to wear down the enemy's stamina.<br><br>'However...'<br><br>The masters hadn't appeared yet. While Bishops were scattered here and there, the Archbishops and apostle-level masters hadn't shown themselves.<br><br>"Let's gooooo!"<br><br>Balder charged forward with a roar, sensing they needed to break through now. His fierce charge seemed to ignite the others, as the Martial Artists on the other bridges also rushed toward the White Blood Religion's walls.<br><br>'Good instincts.'<br><br>Just as Raon smiled faintly and was about to run toward the walls.<br><br>"Palace Master, please rest until the higher apostles appear."<br><br>Burren stepped forward.<br><br>"We will break through this path!"<br><br>He bowed his head as if asking for trust. No, it wasn't just Burren. All of the Light Wind Palace members were looking at him with eyes that seemed to say 'leave it to us.<br><br>"Very well. However..."<br><br>Raon sheathed his Heavenly Drive and took a step back. He lowered his chin heavily as he looked at the swordsmen he had personally trained.<br><br>"You too, wait by my side. Your battle isn't here right now."<br><br>He raised his hand to point at Martha who stood behind Burren. Martha needed to conserve her strength since she might be needed to rescue her mother from the White Blood Religion's Leader.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>While Martha would normally have screamed in refusal, today she understood the importance of the situation and came to his side while biting her lip.<br><br>"Trust in us."<br><br>Burren struck his chest with his fist as if saying to trust and wait.<br><br>"We'll definitely open the path..."<br><br>Runaan looked at Martha not with her usual blank stare, but with intelligent eyes that seemed to contain starlight.<br><br>"Don't die, you bastards..."<br><br>Martha gritted her teeth, saying she would kill them herself if they died. The Light Wind Palace swordsmen smiled faintly at her behavior.<br><br>"Go."<br><br>Raon raised his hand to point at the White Blood Religion's walls, which seemed to flow with white blood.<br><br>"Be the first among the four bridges to break through those walls."<br><br>"We receive your command!"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen charged toward the walls as if receiving a divine command, their swords raised as one.<br><br>"Watch with ease."<br><br>Raon nodded slightly with his arms crossed.<br><br>"How reliable your comrades have become."<br><br>***<br><br>"T-the White Fog has been erased! It will take more than half a day to regenerate!"<br><br>"F-five bridges have been connected between the headquarters and the shore! The Zieghart forces are..."<br><br>"E-even though we cut off the magic flow, the Kraken won't move! It seems to be unconscious!"<br><br>Bad news after bad news reached the White Blood Religion's Leader, who had frozen like a puppet with cut strings.<br><br>"Haah..."<br><br>The White Blood Religion's Leader raised her trembling hand and put a pipe to her mouth.<br><br>"We've been thoroughly outplayed. That damned Ninth Apostle brought these hungry dogs."<br><br>She gritted her teeth as if realizing the Ninth Apostle's actions had led to this situation.<br><br>"Contact Derus Robert. Tell him to come provide support immediately."<br><br>The White Blood Religion's Leader exhaled white smoke and nodded at the Tenth Apostle.<br><br>"And call that damned Thirteenth one too."<br><br>She spoke in a blood-scented voice, ordering them to contact Derus and then call the Thirteenth Apostle.<br><br>"...Understood."<br><br>The Tenth Apostle nodded heavily.<br><br>"First Apostle, wake the Kraken even if you have to take all my blood, and Twelfth Apostle, take the apostles and bishops to defend the walls."<br><br>Despite being furious to her core, the White Blood Religion's Leader assigned the most appropriate tasks for the current situation.<br><br>"It shall be done."<br><br>The First Apostle bowed, saying they would wake the Kraken even if it killed them.<br><br>"Understood. However, what about you, Leader..."<br><br>The Twelfth Apostle tilted their head as if asking what the Leader would do. Only they among the apostles could ask such a question.<br><br>"I will enter deep meditation now."<br><br>The White Blood Religion's Leader crushed her emptied pipe in her grip.<br><br>"Right now, Larian, Chamber, and Raon Zieghart are outside, but others could show up at any time. If I don't break through the wall here and now, we cannot win."<br><br>She clenched her white fist, saying she would complete the final puzzle piece to overcome the wall.<br><br>"That's just like you, Leader."<br><br>The Twelfth Apostle nodded as if approving of the choice.<br><br>"I will hold even if I have to spill all my blood. May your meditation succeed."<br><br>They smiled coldly, vowing they would not let them break through.<br><br>"I too will wake the Kraken as quickly as possible and then support the Twelfth Apostle."<br><br>The First Apostle maintained a steady gaze as if saying not to worry.<br><br>"I will go ahead."<br><br>The Tenth Apostle moved first, saying they would contact Derus.<br><br>"Just wait a little longer..."<br><br>The White Blood Religion's Leader twisted her lips as she listened to the roars of the swordsmen outside the headquarters. She gritted her teeth while exhaling the last smoke in her throat.<br><br>"I'll turn you all into bloodwater."<br><br>***<br><br>"Stop them!"<br><br>"Block these demons threatening our Leader!"<br><br>"Protect the holy ground with your lives!"<br><br>The White Blood Religion followers standing on the walls poured out bloody energy as if ready to die where they stood. The wave of bloody energy rained down on the swordsmen's heads like a downpour.<br><br>"Ignore it and keep going!"<br><br>Balder at the front unleashed his Flexible Sword in a long arc, creating a cloud-like formation. His profound and magnificent swordsmanship split apart all the bloody energy falling like rain.<br><br>"Go in!"<br><br>He roared for them to strike the walls, saying he would cover them.<br><br>"Advance with faith in the Palace Master!"<br><br>"Those aren't Martial Artists, they're fanatics!"<br><br>"Fight without fear!"<br><br>The swordsmen, trusting not just Balder but their respective leaders, charged at the walls and began breaking through the blooming white magic. <br><br>As the swordsmen who had built up their Martial Prowess for two months attacked the walls, the thick defensive magic began to waver in less than ten minutes.<br><br>'There was a reason they asked for trust.'<br><br>Raon nodded with a faint smile.<br><br>'They're definitely strong.'<br><br>Unlike the ragtag White Blood Religion followers, each of Zieghart's swordsmen faced the battle with intense fighting spirit and determination. There was a sense that even if they died here, they believed their comrades would clear the path.<br><br>'I can just watch for now.'<br><br>Just as Raon was about to lower his hand from his sword hilt...The seemingly unconscious Kraken suddenly opened its eyes and began moving its legs. As its massive body writhed, the five bridges that the magicians had connected with all their might shook as if about to collapse.<br><br>"W-what!"<br><br>"The Kraken is moving!"<br><br>"R-run! We'll die like dogs if we stay here!"<br><br>The swordsmen retreated in panic, and even their leaders who had been protecting them were too shocked by the sudden situation to move.<br><br>"I'll go."<br><br>Raon placed his hand on Alice, who was standing guard with him, and drew his Heavenly Drive.<br><br>'I'll have to use a lot of power, but there's no choice.'<br><br>Though it would consume much power to kill the Kraken due to the magic blocking aura, there was no other way. Just as he was about to take a breath and execute his footwork, Haerang, who had been beside him, kicked off the ground and leaped into the sea. <br><br>As soon as Haerang entered, the sea churned, and an equally massive wolf emerged in front of the Kraken that was trying to leave the shore.<br><br>The sound of clashing echoed. Haerang, now even larger than when it was intoxicated by bloody energy, bared its sharp teeth and bit into the Kraken’s leg. Haerang let out a mighty howl, looking up at the sky as if asking the swordsmen of Light Wind Palace to trust it.</p>
