        <p>“What is this book…?”<br><br>Raon swallowed, looking at the burning book. Despite being so worn out that it looked like it would crumble into pieces, it was gleaming with a magnificent golden light, brightening up the audience chamber.<br><br> <br><br>Whir!<br><br> <br><br>Like a flower petal announcing the end of summer, the book drifted down and touched Raon’s fingertip. Despite being on fire, it wasn’t hot. Instead, it held the warmth of a human’s body temperature.<br><br>‘’Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation?”<br><br>Reading the words on the cover, he tried to open the book. At that moment, the pages started turning on their own and the book started to burn more fiercely.<br><br> <br><br>Shatter.<br><br> <br><br>Once it reached the final page, the book turned to ash. They scattered, like used firewood.<br><br>“Huh?”<br><br>Raon tried to grab the disappearing book, but it was pointless. The paper was reduced to powder, and the flame was extinguished into nothing but smoke.<br><br>‘What is this…?’<br><br>As he stood there, unable to comprehend the situation, a message appeared.<br><br> <br><br>[Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation. You have faced an eternal flame.]<br><br>[You remember the Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation.]<br><br> <br><br>As soon as the message finished, his head started to throb as if thunder had struck it.<br><br>‘Hup!’<br><br>It felt like someone had thrust a huge needle into his brain. His knees faltered from a pain greater than that caused by Wrath’s mental attack.<br><br>“Huff…”<br><br>Thankfully, the pain faded quickly, and he managed to avoid falling.<br><br>“Young master!”<br><br>Roenn, who was next to him, came to support him.<br><br>“I… I’m fine.”<br><br>Thanking him, he put strength into his wobbling legs.<br><br>What did you just do?<br><br>‘I don’t know, either. But…’<br><br>He remembered. He could recall the contents of the ‘Ten Thousand Flame Cultivation’, which had been reduced to powder and disappeared.<br><br>“Raon Zieghart.”<br><br>He raised his head to the owner of the slightly trembling voice. Glenn was staring at him with wide eyes. It was an expression that he’d never seen before.<br><br>Raon couldn’t tell if he looked angry or flustered.<br><br>“What have you just done?”<br><br>“I don’t know either. But I remember the contents of the cultivation technique that disappeared from my hand.”<br><br>“What was the name of the book?”<br><br>“It was ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’.”<br><br>“…”<br><br>Hearing Raon’s response, Glenn closed his eyes. After standing as motionlessly as a statue for a while, he opened his eyes. He didn’t look flustered anymore.<br><br>“Did you say you remember the content?”<br><br>“Yes, sir.”<br><br>“Then it’s fine.”<br><br>Glenn waved his hand with his usual cold-hearted expression.<br><br>“You’ve received the reward for returning the bronze tablet. You should leave now.”<br><br>“Hmm…”<br><br>Raon glanced at Roenn. He looked bewildered, but quickly changed into his usual smiling face.<br><br>“…Understood.” <br><br>Raon nodded and stepped backward to leave the audience chamber. Glenn and Roenn stayed immobile until he left completely.<br><br>“Sigh.”<br><br>He couldn’t understand what had just happened.<br><br>‘Did the system grant my mind the ability to memorize the ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’?’<br><br>The system increases your memory and thought processing ability, but it can’t force knowledge into your brain.<br><br>Wrath’s voice also sounded puzzled.<br><br>‘Hmm…’<br><br>Walking through the corridor in the lord’s manor, he mentally skimmed through the ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’.<br><br>He realized it immediately.<br><br>The ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ was a cultivation technique far more profound and meticulous than the ‘Shadow Aura Cultivation’ technique.<br><br>‘Moreover…’<br><br>The ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ didn’t only contain an aura cultivation technique, but also a swordsmanship technique and information about the ancient world.<br><br>If he learned the ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ technique engraved in his memory properly, he would reach a level beyond that of his previous life.<br><br>‘But why did he give this to me?’<br><br>The ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ was too valuable to be exchanged for a mere bronze tablet.<br><br>Nevermind a silver tablet, a gold tablet wasn't even enough for it! He couldn’t understand why Glenn had given it to him.<br><br>Why are you worrying so much when you’ve already received it?<br><br>‘That’s true.’<br><br>There was no way someone like Glenn would make him return whatever he gave out, and he couldn’t return it if he asked, anyway.<br><br>‘Let’s go back.’<br><br>Since he’d only obtained the knowledge, he wanted to return and start cultivating immediately.<br><br>Raon started running towards the annex building as soon as he left the lord’s manor. His eyes were filled with excitement as he ran at full speed.<br><br> <br><br>***<br><br> <br><br>The audience chamber was filled with heavy silence after Raon had left.<br><br>“My… My lord. Was the cultivation technique that the young master Raon received…?”<br><br>“Yes. It was used by that person.”<br><br>Glenn nodded, looking at the empty space on the first partition of the bookshelf.<br><br>‘For him to take the ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’…’<br><br>In the history of Zieghart, no one had managed to take out nor read the first clan leader’s cultivation technique. That technique was the ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ that Raon had just received.<br><br>Glenn had brought out the first bookshelf to grant him a cultivation technique equivalent to a silver tablet, instead of a bronze tablet. He’d never imagined that he would take the ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’.<br><br> <br><br>Gulp.<br><br> <br><br>Roenn swallowed hard, looking at the ashes that were all that remained of the book containing the cultivation technique.<br><br>“If this matter becomes known, young master Raon and Lady Sylvia might be in danger!”<br><br>“You needn’t worry. No one knows about the ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’.”<br><br>Glenn shook his head. The existence of ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ was only known to those who’d already become the head of house. Unless they thoroughly investigated the family’s history, there was no way anyone would know about it.<br><br>“Hmm… Then, what about the book having completely disappeared…?”<br><br>“That’s fine too, since it has been handed down to another person.”<br><br>Raon said he remembered the content of the cultivation book. It was a mysterious phenomenon, but everything would be fine as long as it was handed down.<br><br>“But the ‘Ten Thousand Cultivation’ technique is passed down to the Zieghart’s head of house…”<br><br>“It couldn’t be used, anyway. If it wasn’t for that child, it would’ve ended up rotting away.”<br><br>He was actually surprised.<br><br>No, to be more precise, he was awestruck. However, since it was Raon who manifested a golden flame during the Judgment Ceremony, he felt that Raon was its rightful owner.<br><br>“Since he obtained the first head’s cultivation technique, the young master Raon will become more powerful than anyone else.”<br><br>“That’s not true.”<br><br>Glenn slowly shook his head.<br><br>“Talent and how hard you study martial arts are both important to become strong. However, the most important aspect is the kind of person he is. No matter how powerful the martial art one studies, they cannot surpass a strong human.”<br><br>The reason that Glenn kept organizing the Judgment Ceremony, even after surpassing the demonic wall, was to give adequate advice to talented children.<br><br>Glenn wasn’t judging children’s futures simply by their talents.<br><br>“I beg your pardon. I was so surprised that I made a mistake.”<br><br>Roenn nodded, placing his hand over his chest. Glenn was always saying that the person is more important than the talent, ever since he’d reached a new level of martial arts.<br><br>Although, others in the family only cared about talent and the study of martial arts.<br><br>“Change is coming.”<br><br>Glenn pressed against the back of his throne.<br><br>The ‘Ten Thousand Cultivation’, which had never allowed itself to be handed down, and the golden flame that had appeared only once in the history of the family… Raon had them both.<br><br>‘Raon Zieghart.’<br><br>Glenn couldn’t openly love him, despite Raon being his grandson. And yet, that child was about to bring many changes to the family.<br><br>“It’s going to be fun watching him.”<br><br>If time allowed. Glenn closed his eyes, swallowing those words.<br><br> <br><br>* * *<br><br><br><br>Raon entered his room as soon as he returned. He had told everyone to not enter his room, but he’d locked the door just in case.<br><br>So paranoid.<br><br>‘You should know, too. I might die if I get distracted while cultivating aura.’<br><br>It was fine after a certain level had been reached. However, if someone touched him before his cultivation stabilized, it could cause big trouble.<br><br>That was the reason that he didn’t cultivate the ‘Ring of Fire’ until he went to sleep in his personal bed when he was younger.<br><br>“You shouldn’t distract me, either.”<br><br>Hmph!<br><br>“Are you planning to…”<br><br>Only once.<br><br>A smile showed up from the blue flame.<br><br>“Once?”<br><br>The King of Essence will interrupt you only once while you are doing that cultivation, or whatever.<br><br>“That could cause my body to become disabled before you can take it over.”<br><br>It doesn’t matter.<br><br>A scornful laugh, similar to a beast’s growl, could be heard from Wrath.<br><br>You won’t be able to overcome it, but the King of Essence can revive a body even if its limbs are cut off and the energy center decimated.<br><br>Wrath’s evil voice sent chills down his spine.<br><br>The moment you become disabled and give up on everything is going to be the King of Essence’s opportunity.<br><br>‘As I expected, you are…’<br><br>Raon realized it once again.<br><br>Wrath wasn’t an ally. He was a demon from devildom, and the incarnation of wrath, ready to eat away his mind and body whenever he got the chance.<br><br>“So, are you only doing it once?”<br><br>You already know that the King of Essence doesn’t lie. I will only interrupt you once before you finish learning that cultivation technique.<br><br>“I have no choice, then.”<br><br>Raon rubbed his wrist. Wrath wasn’t going to listen even if he told him not to, so he had no choice but to accept it.<br><br>Tremble in fear every day. You won’t know when the King of Essence will start to attack.<br><br>Wrath’s voice was overly excited. He sounded overjoyed by his ability to tease him for once.<br><br>‘That’s such a small thing to be happy about as a king.’<br><br>It was funny that he was so happy about such a trivial matter when he kept childishly referring to himself as the King of Essence and took pride in being a monarch of devildom and the king of wrath.<br><br>‘However…’<br><br>Wrath’s interruption was going to be dangerous, despite it only happening once.<br><br>The ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ was a cultivation technique that absorbed nature's mana and accumulated aura in the energy field. If he were interrupted at an important moment, his mana circuit or energy field could break.<br><br>It would disable him.<br><br>And it was especially dangerous for Raon, with all the ice in his mana circuit.<br><br>‘But I cannot falter.’<br><br>Considering Wrath’s personality, he was going to push more strongly if he noticed any weakness. No matter the result, he had to stay strong.<br><br>“Alright. Try it, then.”<br><br>Hiding his thoughts, Raon showed a relaxed smile.<br><br>Let’s see how long you can keep up that arrogant expression.<br><br>“You will have to see for the rest of your life.”<br><br>…I want to break your mind right now.<br><br>“Try it. That sounds like free stats to me.”<br><br>Damn insect. Still wet behind the ears… Doesn’t lose a single argument.<br><br>“This insect is always open, so come at me any time.”<br><br>Kuh!<br><br>Raon sat on the bed, waving his hand dismissively. Wrath screamed, exploding in anger, but he was completely ignored.<br><br>‘If he has a brain at all, he isn’t going to interfere right away.’<br><br>Breathing slowly, Raon closed his eyes. Inhaling nature's mana, he filled his body with fresh air. He then exhaled the murky air from his mana circuit.<br><br>‘There are similarities.’<br><br>The flow of ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ and ‘Ring of Fire’ shared similarities, as their names suggested.<br><br>Thinking positively, Raon settled the inhaled mana inside his mana circuit.<br><br>The flow of ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ started from his right wrist. It was an energy as fierce as fire and as haughty as water, all at the same time.<br><br> <br><br>Whir!<br><br> <br><br>The heated mana ran through his body. The ice remaining in his mana circuit was swept away by that majestic flow.<br><br>‘I can’t miss this, either.’<br><br>It would’ve been a waste to throw away the pure ice, so he brought it up to his energy center along with the energy from the ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’.<br><br> <br><br>Whir.<br><br> <br><br>Upon reaching the energy center, the energy from the ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ scattered in vain.<br><br>‘I guess that’s normal.’<br><br>Acquiring the ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ in one single attempt would’ve been unnatural.<br><br>Once using the flow of the ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ felt like breathing to him, the flow would naturally accumulate in his energy center.<br><br>‘Moreover…’<br><br>He was absorbing the ice from his mana circuit, on top of the energy from the ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’. That meant that his ‘Water Resistance’ was going to grow quickly, as well.<br><br>“Haa…”<br><br>Exhaling the heated air after finishing one rotation, Raon opened his eyes.<br><br>Fire attribute, huh?<br><br>“Having only one attribute is a drawback, but it’s an excellent cultivation technique.”<br><br>You say foolish things sometimes.<br><br>“What?”<br><br>That’s the problem with those who don’t learn the attribute properly. A single attribute that is properly mastered isn’t any weaker than a well-rounded user. Back in devildom, the story of the King of Essence freezing an entire castle with icy air was spread throughout history…<br><br>“Hmm.”<br><br>Ignoring Wrath as he started to brag about his past, he focused on what he said before.<br><br>‘A properly mastered single attribute.’<br><br>He was correct.<br><br>Someone who sloppily learned a single attribute was considered half-qualified, but upon reaching a certain level, they were considered as an absolute being.<br><br>He could tell from cultivating only once.<br><br>The ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ was special. It didn’t lose at all to the legendary ‘Ring of Fire’.<br><br>‘I have to learn it properly.’<br><br>Deciding that he would dedicate everything to learning the ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ for a while, he stood up.<br><br>“Before that.”<br><br>Are you taking care of it now?<br><br>“Yes. It’s not a coincidence that they are visiting us every day.”<br><br>Raon’s red eyes glowed like those of a death god.<br><br>It was time to take care of business.<br><br> <br><br>***<br><br> <br><br>Judiel was a new maid, one who had started working in the annex building one month before.<br><br>Thanks to her good impression, cheerful personality, and efficient work, she quickly became trusted by the residents of the annex building.<br><br>However, after finishing the daily chores she told people that she was going to rest. Instead, she climbed the trees in the garden to spy into Raon’s room.<br><br>‘He’s talking to himself again.’<br><br>Judiel narrowed her eyes, watching Raon mumbling to himself. It wasn’t often, but he sometimes talked to himself and stared into thin air.<br><br>She’d heard that he had always been sick, so she thought that was the reason.<br><br>When Raon stopped talking to the air and sat down with his eyes closed, the flow of mana around him suddenly changed.<br><br>He had meditated like that many times before, but it was the first time that the mana started to swirl around him.<br><br>‘As expected, he learned an aura cultivation technique from the lord’s manor.’<br><br>It looked like Raon had used his bronze tablet to learn an aura cultivation technique. The flow of mana was extremely fierce, meaning it was a pretty powerful cultivation technique.<br><br>‘This has to be reported.’<br><br>Judiel climbed down the tree after Raon opened his eyes and turned the light off in his room.<br><br>She went to the small lake at the end of the garden and took out the paper and pencil hidden underground. She wrote down everything Raon had done and everything she managed to learn since she had entered the annex building.<br><br>Mysteriously, the letters on the paper disappeared as soon as she wrote them, and it looked like nothing was ever written on it.<br><br>“This is such a depressing job.”<br><br>Judiel sighed. In order to survive, she was reporting information about a child that could be used against him, and it was making her feel empty.<br><br>“But it has to be done.”<br><br>The bitterness only lasted for a moment. As long as she had something to protect, she had no choice in the matter. That fact filled her empty heart.<br><br> <br><br>Tap.<br><br> <br><br>Judiel folded the paper to the size of a thumbnail and set afloat on the lake. The paper was going to reach Karoon Zieghart by the next morning.<br><br>“Then I shall return… ah!”<br><br>She suddenly stopped as she rose. The cold feeling of steel touching the back of her neck sent her heart pounding.<br><br>“You will die if you open your mouth.”<br><br>As she was looking around in a panic, a cold voice came from behind her.<br><br>“You will die if you move.”<br><br>Her hair stood on end at the sound of the voice, which seemed to contain death.<br><br>“Lower your eyes and look at the lake.”<br><br>Following the voice’s instruction, she lowered her eyes and looked at the lake.<br><br>“Ah…”<br><br>Raon Zieghart’s red eyes were floating above the dark lake, reflecting the night sky.</p>
