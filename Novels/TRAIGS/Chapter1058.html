        <p>"F-Father?"<br><br>Martha stared at Denier with eyes as dull as a dead fish. She dropped the sword she was holding, unable to believe what she was seeing.<br><br>"Why is Father attacking King Lecross...?"<br><br>"An interruption, I see."<br><br>Denier Zieghart frowned as he looked back, not even sparing a glance at Martha. He twisted his wrist holding the sword, as if determined to finish off Lecross for good.<br><br>"Stop!"<br><br>Raon abandoned his pressure on the White Blood Religion leader and used Supreme Harmony Steps. He slashed Frost Snap towards Denier's neck as the latter was about to cleave through Lecross's upper body, tearing through space. Denier lightly dodged Frost Snap by throwing Lecross aside, as if he had predicted Raon's movement.<br><br>'He dodged that?'<br><br>Raon bit his lip as he watched Denier casually avoid his sword strike.<br><br>'A Grandmaster shouldn't be able to dodge at that level.'<br><br>With the Sword Domain still active, Denier as a Grandmaster shouldn't even be able to properly see his sword, yet he easily deflected Raon's attack.<br><br>"You can have that one. Instead..."<br><br>Denier retreated to the right and moved behind the stunned Martha. His movement was as stealthy as a ghost, yet matched the speed of Supreme Harmony Steps.<br><br>"I'll be taking this person."<br><br>He grabbed Martha by the neck, treating his adopted daughter whom he had personally brought and raised like an object.<br><br>"Martha!"<br><br>Raon caught the falling King Lecross with his left arm and gritted his teeth so hard they could crack.<br><br>"F-Father, why...?"<br><br>Martha shed tears that gathered in her eyes, as if pained by Denier's cold gaze as he gripped her neck.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Without giving any answer, Denier used his bloody energy to paralyze Martha's entire body, preventing her from moving.<br><br>"If you touch Martha even slightly in that state..."<br><br>Raon aimed Heavenly Drive, which had returned to its original form as the Divine-Demonic Harmony ended, at Denier's heart.<br><br>"I'll make you experience pain you couldn't even imagine in death."<br><br>He glared at Denier, unleashing anger he hadn't even shown to the White Blood Religion leader.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Denier calmly accepted Raon's fury and tightened his grip on Martha.<br><br>"Nngh..."<br><br>Martha let out a pained breath. She seemed to be suffering more from the sorrow of Denier's betrayal than the physical pain of being choked.<br><br>-I can't believe it.<br><br>Wrath furrowed his brow, unable to comprehend the situation.<br><br>-To think that black-hearted bastard was hiding his power all this time!<br><br>He let out a bitter laugh, saying it was a strength even he hadn't been able to discern.<br><br>'Yes. Denier was a Transcendent...'<br><br>Raon nodded heavily.<br><br>'And at a level similar to mine.'<br><br>How is this possible? Even if he's at a similar level, it should be impossible to deceive Glenn and Wrath. Denier must have some special ability to conceal his power.<br><br>'No wonder I lost track of Denier's movements.'<br><br>Because he never fully trusted Denier, Raon had maintained his aura perception spread around, thinking Denier might stab him in the back.<br><br>It seems Denier sensed this and waited for the moment Raon's concentration shifted to the White Blood Religion leader. Then he unleashed his hidden power and instantly stabbed Lecross from behind. A man with both a vicious and cold-hearted mindset.<br><br>-Damn it! Hurry up and save the beef girl!<br><br>Wrath frantically waved his hands, saying Martha was in danger.<br><br>'I want to unleash my anger on Denier too, but...'<br><br>Now's not the time for that. Raon kept his gaze fixed on Denier while checking Lecross's condition with his left hand.<br><br>'He's not dead yet.'<br><br>Though a sword and bloody energy had pierced the left side of his chest where the heart was, Lecross was still breathing. Raon immediately used Divinity Born from Darkness to heal Lecross's wounds.<br><br>'But for him to survive a surprise attack from behind... Hm?'<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he noticed the dagger lying at Lecross's feet. Judging by the remaining aura, this dagger seemed to have interfered with Denier's sneak attack.<br><br>"It was a matter of split seconds."<br><br>Balder's strong voice came from behind. It appears he had thrown this dagger to slightly deflect Denier's sword.<br><br>"Hey! What the hell are you doing!"<br><br>Balder ran up beside Raon and pointed his finger at Denier.<br><br>"Raon asked me to keep an eye on you, and I thought it'd be a piece of cake, but what is this!"<br><br>He let out a roar loud enough to shake the city, demanding to know what Denier was thinking.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Denier seemed to have nothing to say, not even looking at Balder as he securely restrained Martha and cradled her in his left arm.<br><br>-To think that fool would be useful at a time like this.<br><br>Wrath sighed, saying Balder's simplicity had helped them avoid the worst-case scenario.<br><br>"Ugh..."<br><br>Raon frowned as he looked at Lecross, who was coughing up dark blood with a pale complexion.<br><br>'The wound isn't healing as well as I thought.'<br><br>Denier hadn't simply stabbed with his sword; he had left behind potent bloody energy inside Lecross's body. Even using Divinity Born from Darkness, the wound wasn't closing properly.<br><br>'I have no choice.'<br><br>He'd have to use it all. Raon summoned all of his Divinity Born from Darkness and poured it into Lecross's wound.<br><br>Thanks to the trait reaching 10-star grade, increasing both the quantity and quality of his divine power, he was somehow able to erase Lecross's wound.<br><br>"Haaah..."<br><br>Lecross exhaled violently and spat out the blood in his mouth, as if finally regaining consciousness.<br><br>"I-I'm sorry..."<br><br>His eyes were unfocused, as if he had truly been on the brink of death. Though Lecross was breathing again, his condition wasn't good. He didn't seem capable of fighting.<br><br>"No, I should be the one apologizing."<br><br>Raon gritted his teeth as he looked at Denier, who had his arm around Martha's neck.<br><br>"For not stopping that bastard."<br><br>It was carelessness. If he had firmly suspected and checked Denier as an enemy, he might have been able to prevent this situation. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Martha's complete trust in Denier and his own feeble desire to believe in the Zieghart he loved had led to this current predicament.<br><br>"Aaaaaargh!"<br><br>With the White Blood Religion leader's furious roar, Larian was sent flying and crashed into the rubble of a collapsed building.<br><br>"Damn it!"<br><br>Larian frowned as she discarded her broken dagger.<br><br>"Haaah..."<br><br>As the White Blood Religion leader pulled out the Wooden Ring Sword from her neck and channeled her bloody energy, the wounds carved all over her body slowly began to heal. It was regeneration and recovery using bloody energy.<br><br>"I have returned upon your call."<br><br>Denier went behind the White Blood Religion leader, knelt down, and bowed his head.<br><br>"Honestly, I didn't expect this."<br><br>The White Blood Religion leader twisted her lips as she watched flesh grow to fill the hole in her chest.<br><br>"I didn't think I'd have to use you today."<br><br>She wrinkled her nose, glaring at Raon and Larian as if she still couldn't believe it.<br><br>"It's a good thing we set up a code word in advance."<br><br>The White Blood Religion leader spat out the blood pooled in her mouth, saying she survived thanks to that.<br><br>"Code word? Don't tell me that code word was..."<br><br>Raon parted his trembling lips as he looked at the White Blood Religion leader and Denier.<br><br>"'Come'?"<br><br>The White Blood Religion leader had shouted "Come!" to Raon, Larian, and Lecross when she was in mortal danger.<br><br>Raon had thought it strange that the White Blood Religion leader was trying to fight head-on instead of running away like before, but he never imagined that word was a code to summon Denier.<br><br>"That's right."<br><br>The White Blood Religion leader nodded as she smoothed her now-flawless skin.<br><br>"It was a code word prepared to stab Glenn Zieghart in the back, but I didn't expect to use it in front of you all. Impressive."<br><br>Despite acknowledging their skill, her black eyes flashed with genuine anger as they turned blood-red with killing intent.<br><br>'That word prevented me from reacting.'<br><br>If it had been an out-of-place statement, he would have been suspicious, but since they were preparing for the final battle, it only made him focus more on the fight at hand. As much as he hated to admit it, the preparation of the code word was perfect.<br><br>"What's that bastard's true identity?"<br><br>Raon asked, looking at Denier rather than the White Blood Religion leader.<br><br>"This child is the thirteenth. The 13th Apostle of our main sect."<br><br>The White Blood Religion leader gently stroked Denier's head, as if it no longer mattered to reveal this information.<br><br>"The 13th Apostle was Denier...?"<br><br>Raon bit his lip, having never imagined that the 13th Apostle the 2nd Apostle mentioned as moving was actually Denier.<br><br>"Since when?"<br><br>"From the beginning. The thirteenth is a child I personally created and raised."<br><br>"Created and raised?"<br><br>Denier is Glenn's biological son. While the raising part made sense, the creation part didn't.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Denier seemed unwilling to speak for himself, silently gazing at the White Blood Religion leader with calm eyes.<br><br>"It's a shame to use the dagger meant to pierce Glenn's heart here, but I'll make sure to kill at least you all."<br><br>As the White Blood Religion leader stepped into a stance and clasped her hands, a massive form of a Blood God appeared behind her. It was different from what Raon had seen at Eden's branch or in the South-North Union.<br><br>The Blood God was enormous enough to seem capable of destroying the White Blood Religion headquarters. It had even more arms and weapons, and the halo rising behind its back emitted a radiant light that could push back the sun.<br><br>A powerful wave of bloody energy began to surge through the crumbling White Blood Religion headquarters.<br><br>"Uoooooooh!"<br><br>"The leader has returned!"<br><br>"Oh Blood God!"<br><br>"The white blood will never be erased!"<br><br>As the Godly Blood Summoning Ritual neared completion, the White Blood Religion followers shed tears with their hands clasped. Their eyes showed madness, as if both their bodies and minds were enthralled by the White Blood Religion leader.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>"I-Is that the Blood God?"<br><br>"It's a monster..."<br><br>"How are we supposed to defeat something like that!"<br><br>"Your Majesty..."<br><br>In contrast, the martial artists of Zieghart and Owen who had pushed into the heart of the headquarters trembled in fear as they saw the Godly Blood Summoning Ritual reaching to the sky and King Lecross gasping for breath from his injuries.<br><br>"Heh."<br><br>The White Blood Religion leader curled her lips in satisfaction at the reversed situation as she looked down at Raon and Larian.<br><br>"Today..."<br><br>Raon pressed his lips tightly as he felt the pressure of bloody energy weighing down on his entire body.<br><br>"This really won't be easy."<br><br>***<br><br>"D-Denier betrayed us?"<br><br>Karoon's jaw trembled as he saw Denier reflected in the blue window.<br><br>"How did this happen!"<br><br>He clutched his head in disbelief.<br><br>"Denier..."<br><br>Sheryl clenched her fist so tightly that blood burst from her palm, feeling anger following her initial shock.<br><br>"Huh..."<br><br>Even Roenn lost his characteristic carefree laugh and widened his eyes.<br><br>"L-Lord Denier?"<br><br>"Why? Why would he betray us...?"<br><br>"I can't believe it. Of all people, the direct descendant and son of the Head of House betraying us!"<br><br>The remaining swordsmen in Zieghart expressed deep feelings of betrayal and sorrow towards Denier, who had stabbed Lecross and kidnapped Martha.<br><br>"Haah..."<br><br>Glenn let out a sigh heavy enough to sink the ground as he looked at Denier's sunken eyes.<br><br>'When did they get to him?'<br><br>The Denier he saw before falling into the demon state and the Denier he observed after regaining his senses hadn't changed at all. As a leader, he lacked initiative and seemed incompetent, but his nature was kind and he cared for his subordinates more than anyone else. Glenn had trusted him as much as Karoon, never imagining this outcome.<br><br>'Was he not incompetent, but pretending to be?'<br><br>How? Judging by how he easily dodged Raon's sword strike, Denier was clearly a Transcendent. And a high-level one at that. Glenn couldn't understand how Denier had hidden his power from his eyes.<br><br>'Is it an ability other than martial prowess?'<br><br>Even when he checked Denier's emotions and power before sending support, just in case, he hadn't noticed anything strange. He didn't know what the White Blood Religion leader had done to his son.<br><br>[Damn it!]<br><br>Chamber's irritated voice came from within the blue window.<br><br>[What is this! Why is Denier acting like this!]<br><br>She gritted her teeth, saying she couldn't understand the reason.<br><br>"I'm sorry. I've ruined everything you all prepared..."<br><br>Glenn bowed his head deeply, saying he had no words.<br><br>[Save the apologies for later! Now's not the time to worry about such things!]<br><br>Chamber shook her head, saying it wasn't the time to discuss right and wrong regarding Denier.<br><br>[We need to catch the White Blood Religion leader first. If we let her slip away here, everything will be ruined!]<br><br>She frowned, saying the axis of the Five Kings and Five Demons could be reversed.<br><br>[Lecross is severely injured, Larian has lost her strength, and Raon is exhausted too. Can you go?]<br><br>Chamber raised her eyes filled with trust, saying Glenn was the only one who could move now.<br><br>"I'm sorry, but..."<br><br>Glenn exhaled a short breath as he looked at Chamber.<br><br>"I can't move from here."<br><br>[What? Why not!]<br><br>Chamber's jaw dropped, unable to understand.<br><br>[Derus is holding off that madman! If the Heavenly Demon comes...]<br><br>"No."<br><br>Glenn turned his gaze to the window where the faint sunlight was distorting. He shook his head as he sensed the fierce red fighting spirit rising behind North Grave Mountain, as if calling to him.<br><br>"He's already here."<br><br>***<br><br>The White Blood Religion leader further inflated the aura of the Godly Blood Summoning Ritual, as if intending to crush all of Zieghart and Owen. Just being exposed to that powerful bloody energy made one's body feel heavy and soul feel crushed.<br><br>'This is...'<br><br>Raon lowered his eyebrows as he saw the Blood Demons lining up behind the White Blood Religion leader.<br><br>'I can't see a way out.'<br><br>Lecross was injured and couldn't exert his full strength, Larian had used up all the artifacts she had prepared for the White Blood Religion leader, and Raon himself was drained from opening his Sword Domain. He didn't know how to stop the White Blood Religion leader, Denier, and their fanatical followers.<br><br>"I-It's alright..."<br><br>Lecross raised his sword with his blood-soaked hand.<br><br>"I can still fight."<br><br>He burned with a spirit befitting the name of one of the Five Kings, saying this injury was something he could easily overcome.<br><br>"Experiments don't usually succeed on the first try..."<br><br>Larian levitated a magic-imbued dagger above her head and pulled out a staff that looked like it was made of twisted wood, striking it on the ground.<br><br>"A magician tries until they succeed."<br><br>She nodded, showing no intention of giving up until the end, as befitting a magician. A blue dimensional gate opened between the two who were renewing their determination, and Chamber jumped out.<br><br>"Lady Chamber?"<br><br>Raon widened his eyes as he saw Chamber.<br><br>"Sorry it's not your grandfather."<br><br>Chamber closed her eyes and then opened them, as if that's how things had turned out. It seemed Glenn was unable to move.<br><br>"But that's fine. I work better with these two anyway."<br><br>She grinned as she put a lollipop in her mouth, as if telling Raon not to worry.<br><br>"It seems Glenn Zieghart couldn't come."<br><br>The White Blood Religion leader licked her lips, as if there was nothing left to bother her.<br><br>"Even if the number of insects unable to spread their wings has increased, the result won't change."<br><br>She sneered, sensing Chamber's exhausted state.<br><br>'No.'<br><br>Raon shook his head as he looked at Lecross, Larian, and Chamber.<br><br>'With Lady Chamber here too, we're not completely without hope.'<br><br>Though two of them weren't in their best condition, excluding Larian, the same was true for the White Blood Religion leader.<br><br>'Even if she's healed her wounds, the injuries must still remain inside.'<br><br>The White Blood Religion leader had fully recovered her physical wounds, but her insides must still be damaged.<br><br>'And she must have used up a lot of her power too.'<br><br>The White Blood Religion leader had consumed a large amount of stamina and bloody energy while simultaneously healing her wounds and fighting. Though her power itself had increased by summoning the Blood God, she wouldn't be able to last long either.<br><br>'If we just had one more person...'<br><br>Just as Raon was shaking his head, wishing for one more Transcendent. A terrifying aura exploded from the direction of the city walls. Something wrapped in white bloody energy crashed into a building behind him. <br><br>"Ugh..."<br><br>The person crawling out from the building debris was the First Apostle. He was gasping for breath, having suffered severe injuries that exposed his ribs.<br><br>"Leader! P-Please..."<br><br>Just as the First Apostle was trying to crawl towards the White Blood Religion leader on his bloodied knees.<br><br>A white line traced across the First Apostle's neck, and his head fell off and rolled on the ground like a child's ball. It was a dimensional cut that ignored distance.<br><br>Alice landed on top of the First Apostle's headless corpse, emitting blue air currents.<br><br>"I came to help because I saw something disgusting."<br><br>Alice nodded, saying she had opened her Sword Domain and cut down the First Apostle as soon as she saw the White Blood Religion leader summoning the Blood God.<br><br>"But..."<br><br>She lowered her left eyebrow as she looked at Denier behind the White Blood Religion leader.<br><br>"Why is my brother dyeing his hair like a delinquent and standing over there?"<br><br>Alice tilted her head, unable to understand the situation.<br><br>"Denier Zieghart has betrayed us."<br><br>Raon lowered his gaze towards Alice. He didn't want to tell her this story with her deep wounds, but he had no choice.<br><br>"Betrayed...?"<br><br>Alice's lips trembled as she looked at Lecross, who had been stabbed in the back, and Denier standing behind the White Blood Religion leader.<br><br>"That damn bastard..."<br><br>She raised blood-red air currents over her eyes, seemingly reminded of what happened to Sif.<br><br>"I'll kill that bastard myself. I absolutely cannot forgive..."<br><br>"No."<br><br>Raon blocked Alice's path as she was about to rush at Denier.<br><br>"Aunt, please stop the White Blood Religion leader with the others."<br><br>He pointed at the White Blood Religion leader, who was sneering at them.<br><br>"I'll cut down that traitor myself."<br><br>As Raon unleashed the cold fury sunk deep in his soul, blue frost began to bloom like snowflakes, pushing back the bloody energy filling the area.<br><br>"As quickly and painfully as possible."</p>
