        <p>"Nonsense! Utter nonsense!"<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear gritted his teeth, unable to accept that he only enjoyed fights he could win.<br><br>"I've lived my entire life on the battlefield. It's not about winning fights, but the thrill of combat itself!"<br><br>He shook his head, claiming he never cared about winning or losing in battle.<br><br>"I thought so too."<br><br>Raon slightly shook the Demonic Sword piercing the Demon Slaying Spear's neck. Sticky blood trickled down his throat.<br><br>"I believed you were a Martial Artist worth fighting."<br><br>Since tracking Merlin was a mission from Eden, he thought that could be the case.<br><br>"But I was wrong."<br><br>Raon exhaled briefly and turned around. He bit his lip as he looked at Merlin, wrapped in tattered robes.<br><br>'Merlin...'<br><br>Countless scars marked Merlin's body besides the chest wound. Most were injuries inflicted by the Demon Slaying Spear, igniting anger in his heart.<br><br>"Why did you do something even thugs wouldn't do?"<br><br>Despite having the power to kill Merlin instantly, the Demon Slaying Spear didn't end it, but mutilated her body like a child pulling the legs off an insect. It felt strangely disconnected from the Demon Slaying Spear's bold attitude he had seen at the previous Five Divine Orders festival.<br><br>-He was always that kind of bastard!<br><br>Wrath snorted at the Demon Slaying Spear.<br><br>-This king has never seen a proper one among those obsessed with fighting!<br><br>He shook his head, saying all those who love war are out of their minds.<br><br>'Not everyone.'<br><br>Raon lowered his eyes slightly.<br><br>'Like Axe King Roman.'<br><br>Axe King Roman lived to fight against the strong. Even when mortally wounded, he acknowledged defeat with a satisfied smile. That image of a true warrior to the end was unforgettable.<br><br>-Hmm, this king didn't see everything...<br><br>Wrath furrowed his brow.<br><br>-But that guy seemed the craziest of all?<br><br>He said such madness was rare even in Devildom.<br><br>"No! I couldn't have done that!"<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear clutched his head, unable to believe he had been gripped by fear or tormented the weak.<br><br>'This is pointless.'<br><br>Feeling no need to deal with the Demon Slaying Spear further, Raon tightened his grip on the Demonic Sword.<br><br>"Die."<br><br>Just as the Demonic Sword was about to sever the Demon Slaying Spear's neck...<br><br>"I am Kern the Demon Slaying Spear! I fear nothing!"<br><br>As the Demon Slaying Spear roared, black flames erupted from his neck, deflecting the blade of the Demonic Sword. The Demon Slaying Spear seized the opportunity, stepping back and stomping his foot. A massive tremor shook the earth, splitting the ground, and bright flames rose from below.<br><br>'Flames? No, that's...'<br><br>Raon's eyes widened as he saw the flames shooting up from the ground.<br><br>'A horse!'<br><br>What emerged from the earth was not flames, but a warhorse much taller than himself. It was a mystical steed with skin burning bright red, a golden saddle, and a sky-blue bladed halberd tied to its side.<br><br>'The warhorse Blood Horn and the Flame Halberd.'<br><br>The beloved weapon and mount that made the Demon Slaying Spear an invincible general manifested from the ground filled with black blood.<br><br>"I was born on the battlefield and raised there. Both the weak and strong are merely my prey!"<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear shouted that this was all there was to it as he mounted Blood Horn. As the Demon Slaying Spear became one with Blood Horn, the foul stench emanating from him was erased by the horse's neigh.<br><br>"I'll show you! Who I really am!"<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear yelled for him to come at him, pointing the black spear at himself. The dim light in his eyes faded, revealing their original blue color.<br><br>'That's right.'<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he looked at the Demon Slaying Spear sitting straight like a general of heaven.<br><br>'The Demon Slaying Spear originally rode that horse.'<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear's weapon wasn't just the spear. He was a Martial Artist who could only exert his full power after mounting the warhorse Blood Horn.<br><br>'So this is where the real fight begins.'<br><br>As Raon licked his lips and adjusted his grip on the Divine Sword and Demonic Sword, black flames erupted from the demonic spear the Demon Slaying Spear was holding, causing his eyes to flicker with an ominous gray light once again.<br><br>'That spear...'<br><br>Raon let out a low groan as he looked at the black spear spewing endless black flames.<br><br>'Something's not right.'<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear's weapon wasn't that black spear, but the Flame Halberd tied to Blood Horn's saddle. He couldn't understand why he was holding such a strange spear instead of his beloved weapon, powerful enough to be called a demonic spear.<br><br>'It's not like he got a new weapon... Ah!'<br><br>Recalling his conversation with the Demon Slaying Spear and his reactions, Raon bit his lip.<br><br>"You..."<br><br>Raon lowered his eyebrows as he met the Demon Slaying Spear's hazy eyes.<br><br>"What did The Fallen do to you?"<br><br>No matter how he looked at it, the Demon Slaying Spear's current state wasn't normal. People's personalities can change, but this guy was far beyond that level.<br><br>'Come to think of it, it's strange that he was quietly staying in Eden.'<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear was a battle maniac who left the Five Divine Orders to fight on the Four Demon's side. It was odd that such a madman had been quietly staying in Eden all this time before receiving a mission.<br><br>"What do you mean, done to me! What nonsense!"<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear screamed, adamantly denying it.<br><br>"Shut up and come at me! It'll be different from before!"<br><br>He grabbed Blood Horn's reins, saying this was the real deal now. Blood Horn neighed and kicked the ground, and suddenly the Demon Slaying Spear's spear tip was rushing towards Raon's eyes.<br><br>'Fast.'<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear's movements had become fast enough to pierce through his senses. It was surprising how the horse was faster and more agile than a Transcendent's footwork.<br><br>'And the power of his spear strikes has increased too.'<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear hadn't just gotten faster; his spear techniques and aura had also been strengthened. Just by mounting the horse, it seemed like his entire level of martial prowess had changed.<br><br>'However...'<br><br>Raon twisted his wrist, swinging the frost-blazing Demonic Sword diagonally upward. The Crimson Slash unleashed by the Demonic Sword blocked the Demon Slaying Spear's faster and more ferocious assault head-on without wavering.<br><br>'It won't make much difference.'<br><br>Even with the increased strength, speed, and aura, he could easily handle it with his current martial prowess. No, he could definitely win.<br><br>"Not yet!"<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear tilted his black spear forward like cavalry. Black flames engulfed his entire body and Blood Horn's as they charged towards Raon as one spear. The earth twisted and the sky warped from the heat of the black flames as horse and rider became one in this charging spear technique.<br><br>Even before it made contact, Raon felt his skin and bones being crushed.<br><br>Raon concentrated the flames of the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation on the tip of his Divine Sword just as the Demon Slaying Spear's charge reached right in front of him. <br><br>Raon Zieghart Style Sword Technique. Second Form: Heavy Sky Cannon.<br><br>The golden flames condensed into a small sphere, then generated an immense gravitational force that blocked the Demon Slaying Spear's charge. The Demon Slaying Spear and Blood Horn's charge froze, unable to even reach him, stopped by the gravitational force of the Heavy Sky Cannon.<br><br>"W-What is this..."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear's hazy eyes widened, as if he never imagined he wouldn't even be able to approach.<br><br>"It's not over yet."<br><br>Raon shook his head at the seemingly bewildered Demon Slaying Spear.<br><br>"Try to block this."<br><br>Before finishing his words, he unleashed the flames concentrated on his sword tip. An enormous force exploded between the Divine Sword and the black spear, melting the earth and raising golden flames that seemed to split the sky.<br><br>"Urgh..."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear managed to survive by hastily dodging, but his face, arms, and legs were bright red as if severely burned.<br><br>"Why..."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear looked up at him with trembling eyes.<br><br>"I was clearly faster and stronger, so how..."<br><br>His lips quivered, still unable to accept this outcome.<br><br>"You're right. You did get stronger."<br><br>Raon nodded calmly.<br><br>"Just in strength, speed, and aura."<br><br>Even in battles between Transcendents, strength, speed, and aura are certainly important factors. But more crucial is what value one has built in their martial arts and what beliefs they hold. From clashing swords and spears in the realm of transcendence, he realized the Demon Slaying Spear's soul was empty.<br><br>"Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!"<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear raised his black spear, screaming that he couldn't accept this. Blood Horn let out a somewhat sorrowful neigh as it followed its master's command and kicked the ground.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear blocked Raon's heavy sword strike and twisted his dried lips into a smile.<br><br>'I can hold on!'<br><br>Raon's sword strikes were certainly strong and solid, but not enough to pierce through his bones and flesh. If they kept fighting, he would inevitably win by utilizing the demonic power of the black spear.<br><br>"I'll keep going!"<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear shouted a battle cry and unleashed spear strikes aimed at Raon's entire body. But Raon blocked all his moves without difficulty, as if reading every technique. Changing the forms of the Demon God Spear made no difference.<br><br>'What kind of guy is he...'<br><br>He had faced many so-called geniuses through countless wars, but never someone like Raon. Though they were clearly at a similar level, it felt like facing a Transcendent far above him.<br><br>'It's fine! If I go all the way, I'll win!'<br><br>He had his battlefield experience and the demonic spear giving him endless power. He was confident he would definitely win if they fought to the very end. Just as the Demon Slaying Spear deflected Raon's fierce sword strikes and was about to charge again, Blood Horn let out a murky groan and its legs trembled as if about to collapse.<br><br>"What are you doing! At this crucial moment... Huh?"<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear's eyes widened as he grabbed the reins to steady Blood Horn.<br><br>"Blood Horn?"<br><br>The red flames burning on Blood Horn's body had dimmed as if about to go out. Though he had been with this creature for many years, he had never seen it like this before.<br><br>'No way...'<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear's jaw trembled as he looked at Blood Horn, which was sweating blood from its entire body.<br><br>'You... for me?'<br><br>Seeing Blood Horn's condition, it seemed the creature had been absorbing all the shock from Raon's sword strikes to prevent it from reaching him. Blood Horn unsteadily raised its trembling legs and neighed with difficulty, as if to say it was fine.<br><br>"Urgh."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear let out a low groan as he stroked Blood Horn's sunken mane.<br><br>'Why didn't I notice this...?'<br><br>Though an Artifact, Blood Horn was his beloved mount, comrade, and family. He couldn't understand why he hadn't cared about its condition until now.<br><br>'Come to think of it, how long has it been since I last summoned it?'<br><br>He used to summon Blood Horn daily to give it the carrots it loved, but now that he thought about it, this seemed to be the first time in a very long while.<br><br>'Eden, The Fallen... Ah!'<br><br>As the Demon Slaying Spear pressed his temples with his fingers, trying to recall his memories, the black spear vibrated violently and erupted in black flames. Along with the black flames, something pitch black invaded his mind, and he couldn't stop it.<br><br>"Urgh!"<br><br>He tried to erase the strange force seeping into his upper dantian by raising his aura, but it didn't work.<br><br>'Could it be...'<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear swallowed dryly as he looked at the black spear that kept blazing against his will.<br><br>'This spear?'<br><br>This black spear was an ancient weapon The Fallen had given him when inviting him to Eden. He had refused at first, saying he already had the Flame Halberd called a demonic spear, but accepted it when told to at least try wielding it once.<br><br>'I only meant to try it once, so why have I been using this spear all along?'<br><br>Though the black spear was certainly an excellent weapon, the Flame Halberd was like his life itself. He had intended to just accept it without using it, but at some point he had been wielding only this black spear.<br><br>'That's not all.'<br><br>His memories after entering Eden were hazy. All he could remember was having daily conversations with The Fallen and receiving this mission.<br><br>"Ha..."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear let out a hollow laugh and bit his lip.<br><br>"To think you'd use such a cheap trick!"<br><br>Now he understood what Raon had said. He had lost something due to The Fallen's actions.<br><br>'That damned mask-wearer...'<br><br>It seemed The Fallen had done this to prevent him from leaving Eden for somewhere else.<br><br>"Damn it!"<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear cursed and stomped his foot. Even now, the black spear was pushing a strange force into his mind as if trying to devour his consciousness.<br><br>"I'll throw you away!"<br><br>Since he couldn't become someone else of his own will, he threw away the black spear despite Raon being right in front of him. But even after discarding the black spear, his mind didn't clear. Rather, his vision became more blurred, and he felt an urge to grab the spear again, like a drug addict.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Raon seemed to sense his change and stood waiting.<br><br>"Urgh..."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear's entire body trembled as he vomited black blood.<br><br>'S-Spear...'<br><br>He needed the spear. The black spear was calling to him. It was trampling his mind and heart with its remaining power, screaming for him to grab it.<br><br>'I-I can't...'<br><br>In his current weakened mental state, he couldn't resist the black spear's temptation. He dismounted from Blood Horn to grab the black spear again. Blood Horn neighed sorrowfully. As he bent down to grab the spear, his eyes met Blood Horn's. He could see his own reflection in the mount's black eyes.<br><br>Seeing not the image of a general commanding the battlefield, but shaking hands and eyes like those of an addict, his soul felt like it would burst.<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear pulled back the hand reaching for the black spear and bit his tongue so hard it nearly severed.<br><br>"Don't worry..."<br><br>He spat out blood, kicked away the black spear, and stood up grasping the Flame Halberd tied to Blood Horn's saddle.<br><br>"It seems..."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear looked at Raon with a twisted smile.<br><br>"You were right. The Fallen did something dirty to me."<br><br>He nodded, saying he had to admit it.<br><br>"Before I become that bastard's puppet again..."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear raised the Flame Halberd and pointed it at Raon.<br><br>"Let's end this, Raon Zieghart!"<br><br>"It'll be dangerous in your condition."<br><br>Raon lowered his eyebrows, seemingly already aware of the Demon Slaying Spear's state.<br><br>"The Zieghart family has people skilled in medicine and holy power, so we could treat you..."<br><br>"No..."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear shook his head and spat out the black blood in his mouth.<br><br>"I don't have much time left."<br><br>He bit his lip, as if begging to fight in his current state.<br><br>"Please..."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear bowed his head, imploring.<br><br>"Let me die as a Martial Artist."<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Raon furrowed his brow as he looked at the Demon Slaying Spear with desperate eyes.<br><br>'What did they do to that spear?'<br><br>No, it wasn't just the spear. The Demon Slaying Spear was an experienced warrior who knew the battlefield. There's no way they could have brainwashed such a Transcendent with just one weapon. They must have used various methods like magic, food, and formations, though he didn't know the details.<br><br>'And made it so he can't escape.'<br><br>Judging from the Demon Slaying Spear's condition, it seemed they had ensured his body would break down with withdrawal symptoms if he didn't wield the black spear. In this situation, there was only one thing he could do.<br><br>"Come."<br><br>Raon exhaled softly and nodded.<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear nodded and grasped Blood Horn's reins.<br><br>"Let's go! My comrade!"<br><br>He charged forward with Blood Horn, calling for them to advance together to the end. The Demon Slaying Spear whirled the Flame Halberd above his head, raising tremendous flames.<br><br>Blood Horn, though unable to speak, seemed to understand everything as it leapt from the crumbled earth, creating the perfect height and angle for the Demon Slaying Spear's strike to exert its maximum power.<br><br>Demon God Spear Ultimate Technique: Burning Heaven Slash. Riding the warhorse blazing with red flames, unleashing a spear strike that seemed to collapse the sky, the Demon Slaying Spear truly embodied a demonic spear and mounted spear.<br><br>"With full power."<br><br>Raon took a deep breath as he raised the Divine Sword above his shoulder and held the Demonic Sword behind his waist. In the stance of the drawing cut. Resolving to cleave through anything, he extended both swords.<br><br> Raon Zieghart Style Sword Technique. Sixth Form Divine-Demonic Harmony Linked Technique: Invincible Azure-Red Sword.<br><br>The ultimate techniques of the Demon God Spear, uniting man and horse, and the dual sword style clashed at the intersection of heaven and earth. A terrifying force collided, creating pitch-black cracks as if connecting heaven and earth, and crimson whirlwinds rose from all directions.<br><br>Raon and the Demon Slaying Spear stood motionless after passing each other, as if completely unaffected by the massive aftermath.<br><br>"How was it."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear asked without even turning his head.<br><br>"Was it a spear that despised the weak until the end?"<br><br>He trembled, as if eager to know.<br><br>"No."<br><br>Raon firmly shook his head. Looking at the trace of the spear strike tearing his chest and spilling blood, he curled his lips.<br><br>"It was an excellent spear that challenged those above."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear's final strike contained the conviction befitting the master of a demonic spear that he had hoped for. So much so that even giving his all, he couldn't avoid a severe injury.<br><br>"I see."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear nodded as if finally satisfied, then fell limply from Blood Horn's saddle.<br><br>"Kuh..."<br><br>He exhaled emptily as he looked at the sword wound that seemed to tear his chest apart.<br><br>"Even if I had been in my right mind, I would have lost in the end."<br><br>As the Demon Slaying Spear acknowledged defeat, the blade of the Flame Halberd in his hand crumbled like an old glass window.<br><br>"Though I'm in this state, I have one request."<br><br>"What is it?"<br><br>Raon tilted his chin at the Demon Slaying Spear.<br><br>"That one..."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear pointed at Blood Horn, which had slumped down beside him.<br><br>"Please take it with you."<br><br>He bowed his head, pleading. Blood Horn crawled towards the Demon Slaying Spear on weakened legs, as if unwilling to leave its master.<br><br>"Thank you for staying with such an unworthy master."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear smiled as he stroked Blood Horn's forehead.<br><br>"That guy will treat you better than I did. Go with him."<br><br>He shook his head, saying their journey ended here.<br><br>"Haa..."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear raised his hand as if all strength had left him.<br><br>"Before I die, let me tell you what I know."<br><br>"What you know?"<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes at the Demon Slaying Spear.<br><br>"Eden, Derus, and the White Blood Religion are working together more closely than your Five Kings think. And what Eden is preparing isn't just the revival of the Demonic Dragon... Ah."<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear's breath ceased before he could finish his last words. Blood Horn licked the cheek of the Demon Slaying Spear, who died with eyes still open, as large tears fell from its eyes.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Raon nodded, etching the Demon Slaying Spear's words into his mind so as not to forget them, then returned to where he had left Merlin.<br><br>'Thankfully, she's safe.'<br><br>Since he had been careful not to harm Merlin, no new injuries had been inflicted on her body. However, her condition hadn't improved, so he needed to take her back quickly. A massive rumble came from outside the forest as Raon was about to lift Merlin onto his back.<br><br>'Mark Goetun.'<br><br>It seemed Mark Goetun, who had been covering his rear, was still fighting. He had been sensing his presence all along, but his current state didn't seem good.<br><br>'I need to go back quickly... Ah!'<br><br>Raon stopped as he was about to run out of the forest.<br><br>'Right. That bell.'<br><br>He approached the lifeless Demon Slaying Spear and took out the bell from his possession.<br><br>"Hmm?"<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he looked at the bell with a dark red glow.<br><br>"This bell..."</p>
