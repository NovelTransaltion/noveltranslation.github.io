        <p>“You can change my constitution?”<br><br>Saint Olga froze as if she had heard something she had never even imagined.<br><br>“To be precise, you squeezed your body to extract divine power. Rather than changing your constitution, it's more accurate to say that I'm fixing all the bad parts.”<br><br>Raon glanced at the black lines etched across Olga’s entire body and let out a short sigh.<br><br>Seeing that there were even more lines than when she first arrived, it was clear that she had once again forced herself to extract divine power during this war.<br><br>“Those black scars will probably fade too.”<br><br>“You can do that? How?”<br><br>Olga trembled her red lips in disbelief.<br><br>“My friend knows how.”<br><br>From the moment he first saw her, Wrath had noticed Olga's condition and told her that even demons could experience such cases.<br><br>With his own transcendent realm and Wrath's knowledge and senses, changing Olga's constitution was not an impossible task.<br><br>“Hmm...”<br><br>Olga bit her lip slightly as she looked at the black lines covering her entire right hand.<br><br>“This isn't just a reaction to divine power; it's my past and my present.”<br><br>She ran her trembling hand over the black lines etched into her arm.<br><br>“......”<br><br>Raon lowered his hand, keeping his mouth shut so Olga could explain her situation.<br><br>“Did I mention before? I was born with more divine power than anyone else. That's why I was given the name ‘Saint,’ even though it doesn't fit me.”<br><br>Olga clenched her trembling fist. The black lines etched into her fingers connected, making it look as though she were wearing black gloves.<br><br>“Though I possessed nearly infinite divine power, the physical body tasked with handling it was no different from others. It was like having an overflowing pitcher of water, but the pitcher itself was made of paper.”<br><br>Olga pressed her fingernails into her own skin, which had melted into black, and asked if it was interesting.<br><br>“When you consume divine power at the level of a high priest, you feel a pain as if your skin is melting. No, your body is actually melting.”<br><br>She pointed to the black lines that could no longer be hidden by tattoos and smiled wryly.<br><br>“But it was enjoyable. Helping others with my abilities brought me happiness beyond the pain.”<br><br>Olga gazed out the window at the sea, recalling the past, and drew a faint smile.<br><br>“But people began to demand more and more. They didn’t care about my pain or emotions at all.”<br><br>Olga let out a bitter laugh and took a cigarette from her pocket and put it in her mouth.<br><br>“I wanted to take care of many people, but at some point, I ended up only dealing with rich, powerful people.”<br><br>Perhaps because she thought of herself as a patient, she didn't light the cigarette and held it in her hand again.<br><br>“So instead of acting like a saint, I acted like a thug and did as I pleased. I left the rich men who weren’t in urgent need and went to the back alleys to care for dying children. I left the nobleman with a slightly cut finger and went to the battlefield to use my divine power on dying soldiers.”<br><br>Olga drew a refreshing smile, saying that was much better and happier.<br><br>“Using my power as I pleased, even the pain was bearable. At some point, they started calling me the ‘trash saint,’ but I actually liked it. Of course, in our kingdom, they tried to hide that nickname.”<br><br>She shook her hands lightly, as if amused.<br><br>“So it’s okay. These scars are my glorious wounds, and if I control my divine power, I can live a long life. Don’t worry.”<br><br>Olga shook her head calmly, saying she didn’t need any treatment.<br><br>“No, you can’t.”<br><br>Raon shook his head, looking into Olga’s eyes.<br><br>“Huh? What can’t I?”<br><br>“Both.”<br><br>She raised her finger and shook her head.<br><br>“You know better than anyone else. You don’t have much time left.”<br><br>Raon raised his finger and pointed at Olga’s tattoo.<br><br>“Your divine power is growing stronger and stronger. Just by using it, the power that melts your body continues to accumulate, and it’s impossible for your body to withstand it. At some point, it will inevitably collapse.”<br><br>Olga said that she possessed more divine power than anyone else. However, her body was ordinary, so it wouldn't be long before not only her skin but also her bones and muscles melted away.<br><br>“Once that happens, even if you want to fix it, you won't be able to. You won't even be able to lie down for a few months before you die.”<br><br>“Hmm...”<br><br>Olga frowned as if she already knew this.<br><br>“Plus, you're worried about those wounds, aren't you?”<br><br>Raon smiled faintly and pointed to the black lines covering Olga's skin.<br><br>“What nonsense! I don't care at all!”<br><br>Olga shook her head vigorously, insisting it wasn't true.<br><br>“You always say that women’s skin must be free of scars when you treat them. Two days ago, when you treated Lencia, you took her back to remove the scars.”<br><br>She insisted that women’s skin must be free of scars and tried her best to remove the scars.<br><br>It was both her desire to achieve the beautiful skin she herself lacked and her consideration for others.<br><br>Since her own skin had melted away, she could have caused others to suffer the same pain, but seeing her pour her divine power into healing them, she was a kinder person than she appeared.<br><br>“No, that’s not it! You idiot! You fool. Tinguya!”<br><br>Olga blushed and shook her head vigorously.<br><br>“Tinguya? I don’t know what that means.”<br><br>Raon smiled wryly at Olga’s flustered expression.<br><br>“Anyway, come with me to Zighart. I’ll fix you no matter what.”<br><br>“But…”<br><br>Olga didn’t answer right away, biting her lip deeply.<br><br>“If there’s something to gain, there’s also something to lose. To fix me, you’ll have to make a lot of sacrifices…”<br><br>Even in a life-threatening situation, Olga thought of him first. She said she wasn't a saint, but she had a heart more saintly than anyone else.<br><br>“Well, it'll be a little tiring, but there won't be any major sacrifices. As I said, we have a guide.”<br><br>Zigehart had the ragged saint Fredric, and Wrath knew the way, so they would be able to treat Olga without any problems. Of course, it will be quite tiring.<br><br>“Ugh...”<br><br>Olga seemed to have nothing more to say and just moved her lips.<br><br>“With the snow-white skin you desire so much...”<br><br>“I don't want it!”<br><br>She shouted no and left the hospital room. She seemed very embarrassed that her true feelings had been revealed.<br><br>“Stay here. Don't go to Schper.”<br><br>After hearing his last words, he noticed the sound of footsteps, and it seemed that Olga would not go to Schper but would accompany him to Ziegart.<br><br>-It seems you want to save her no matter what.<br><br>‘I received a lot of help this time, and I want that guy to live a long life.’<br><br>Saint Olga is someone who can play a role greater than that of a transcendent being in the upcoming war.<br><br>However, aside from her strengths, he wanted to save her as a person.<br><br>Huuuuu!<br><br>As Raon smiled at the door of the hospital room that Olga had slightly opened and left, a pink-colored current fell from the sky with a gloomy aura.<br><br>[Wrath....]<br><br>Lust's sultry voice brushed past his ears coldly.<br><br>[I know you have a special purpose for entering the human world. But I hope you don't get too close to other women?]<br><br>She revealed her chilling eyes from within the pink stream, reminding him of their promise.<br><br>-Kiaaaah!<br><br>As soon as Lust looked into her eyes, she screamed and hid under the bed.<br><br>“What are you going to do about that stalker? She's already gone mad!”<br><br>Wrath trembled, saying that Lust's lust was overflowing.<br><br>“No.”<br><br>Raon shook his head calmly as he looked into Lust's excited eyes.<br><br>“The way I think of that child is completely different from the way I think of you.”<br><br>He said no more and closed his mouth.<br><br>[Different? Different...].<br><br>Lust repeated the word “different” and stared blankly.<br><br>[That's right. I am different].<br><br>Satisfied with the word “different,” she breathed heavily into his ear and then disappeared into thin air again.<br><br>-Eh...?<br><br>Wrath blinked blankly.<br><br>“What does ‘different’ even mean that made that stalker so satisfied?”<br><br>He tilted his head in confusion.<br><br>“It's exactly what you heard.”<br><br>“But why did that stalker react like that?”<br><br>“People often hear others' words the way they want to hear them. Lust interpreted the words ‘different’ the way she wanted to.”<br><br>He smiled, saying that's why he was satisfied and backed off.<br><br>-The way she wanted? ...Wait a minute!<br><br>Wrath rolled his eyes from side to side and screamed.<br><br>-Then I'll have to deal with all of that later!<br><br>“...Right?”<br><br>-Right my ass! Are you crazy?<br><br>He let out a breath of exasperation, as if he couldn't believe it.<br><br>“I'm going to lose my mind! How did I end up meeting such a lunatic!”<br><br>Wrath trembled all over as he watched Lust's satisfied smile.<br><br>“Blessings come to those who wait.”<br><br>“You're the one who won't let me wait!”<br><br>As Wrath screamed and lunged forward, he heard hurried footsteps outside the hospital room.<br><br>Kuuung!<br><br>Whether Olga had told them or not, Buren, Martha, Runan, and the inspectors from the Storm Front opened the door at the same time.<br><br>However, they weren't the first to enter the hospital room.<br><br>“Raon.”<br><br>Glen, who had appeared out of nowhere, entered the hospital room first and stood in front of his bed.<br><br>“Are you okay?”<br><br>He was still looking worried, his eyebrows deeply furrowed.<br><br>“My head is a little dizzy, but everything else is fine.”<br><br>Raon raised his arm to show Glen that he was feeling better so that he wouldn't worry.<br><br>“Well, that's a relief.”<br><br>Glen couldn't look Raon in the eye and nodded slightly with his eyes downcast.<br><br>“......”<br><br>Raon tilted his chin slightly as he looked at Glen, who was avoiding his gaze. It was so different from when he had shown everyone how he was holding her in front of many people that he was taken aback again.<br><br>“Cough! As long as you're okay, that's fine. Then let's talk.”<br><br>Glenn awkwardly turned around as if he had only come to check on his condition and left the hospital room.<br><br>“Huh? Master? Are you leaving already?”<br><br>Roen's voice came from outside the door. He seemed surprised that Glenn had left so quickly.<br><br>“I saw that he woke up, so that's fine.”<br><br>Glen's voice trembled slightly as he dragged Roen outside.<br><br>“I guess you're embarrassed.”<br><br>Martha smiled as she looked at the door Glen had left through.<br><br>“He was embarrassed about hugging us suddenly, so he couldn't even look us in the face...”<br><br>Berren scratched the back of his head and smiled awkwardly.<br><br>“I liked it.”<br><br>Runan said he liked it because it felt like meeting his real grandfather and licked his lips.<br><br>“I see…”<br><br>Raon smiled faintly as he looked at the floor where Glen had been standing. As he had expected, Glen had been too emotional two days ago.<br><br>“How’s it going outside?”<br><br>“The cleanup is almost done.”<br><br>Martha nodded.<br><br>“There were more people with black hearts than we thought, but luckily the Schper priests helped us remove them all.”<br><br>She raised her thumb, saying that they had not only destroyed the Black Tower, but also saved the residents of Montiro.<br><br>“That's a relief.”<br><br>The Super priests and clergy seemed to be of great help not only in the battle against the Black Tower, but also in the recovery phase that followed. It was a good call to call them, and I was grateful that they came.<br><br>“Many people came to help after hearing that the Black Tower had collapsed. Not only our neutral forces, but also many people who had been lost came to help.”<br><br>Berren pointed outside, saying that there was more vitality than during the resort days.<br><br>“I think this place will do even better if it returns to being a resort. People can come to see the collapsed Black Tower.”<br><br>He smiled, saying that there was no need to worry about Montiro.<br><br>“Ah...!”<br><br>Runaan raised her hand as if she had thought of something to say.<br><br>“There's a rumor that there's a little kid who's been eating all the food lately...”<br><br>She nodded, saying that all the food in every restaurant was disappearing.<br><br>“Oh, right. If we hadn't gotten support from all over the continent, we would've all starved, right? They say that a little kid has been eating all the meals and desserts all day long.”<br><br>Burren laughed, saying he had heard that story too.<br><br>“Huh...”<br><br>Raon exhaled briefly.<br><br>-Damn food-eating monster!<br><br>‘Gluttony...’<br><br>Since he had asked her to wait, Gluttony seemed to be waiting here, eating all the food.<br><br>He needed to get up quickly and meet her to give her the money.<br><br>'Demons are all peculiar, aren't they?'<br><br>As he sighed briefly while looking at Lust in the air, the hospital room door opened again, and Chamber and Lencia, wrapped in bandages, entered.<br><br>“Raon-nim!”<br><br>Lencia ran over and hugged him as soon as she saw him.<br><br>“I’m so glad you’re safe!”<br><br>She teared up, saying she had heard that he had suddenly collapsed and was worried.<br><br>“I just fainted from exhaustion. My head just hurts a little. Don’t worry.”<br><br>Raon patted Rensia’s trembling back.<br><br>“A headache is the most dangerous thing. That’s why I’m recovering here, isn’t it?”<br><br>Chamber shook her head, rolling a candy in her mouth.<br><br>“Are you okay, Chamber?”<br><br>“Am I okay? I’m on the verge of death.”<br><br>She frowned, saying that her head still felt like it was going to split open.<br><br>“Still, if it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t be on the verge of death—I would be dead. Thank you.”<br><br>Chamber said he had fought well and gently placed her small hand on his shoulder.<br><br>“No, if Chamber hadn’t stepped in at the end, we never would have won.”<br><br>He meant it. There was a vast difference between himself and the Black Tower Lord. If Chamber hadn’t risked her life to use her final technique, he would have been the one to die.<br><br>“You’re still so humble.”<br><br>Chamber smiled as if she had expected it.<br><br>“You don’t seem like someone who would receive such a title.”<br><br>“What title?”<br><br>Raon blinked, confused.<br><br>“You’ve been given a new title.”<br><br>Chamber took the candy he had been chewing and pointed it at him like a sword.<br><br>“A name closer to that of the continent’s absolute ruler than anything before.”</p>
