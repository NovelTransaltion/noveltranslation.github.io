        <p>'This is....'<br><br>Raon chewed his lips as he recalled the sender of the brief and concise letter.<br><br>'It's a letter from Merlin.'<br><br>It wasn't because of that pure scent emanating from Merlin. Just seeing the words of gratitude written on the back of the letter was enough to remind him of her.<br><br>-I-Is that a letter from the madwoman?<br><br>Wrath's eyelids trembled slightly, as if frightened by just the letter.<br><br>'Yes. Merlin always said she was going to look for Eden.'<br><br>After she left, Merlin was often away, saying she would search for Eden's main altar and the hidden Heavenly Demon, which had changed location. There had been no news for a while, but it seemed she had finally found Eden's location.<br><br>-Indeed, befitting a madwoman, her handwriting is as messy as a worm's trail.<br><br>Wrath nodded, saying it was fitting for a woman who wasn't in her right mind.<br><br>-No, that's not it...<br><br>The fellow let out a low groan after examining the letter closely.<br><br>'You're right. It's not that she can't write, but that the situation was so urgent she could only write like this.'<br><br>Raon had seen Merlin's handwriting when she stayed in Zieghart. Although her writing style looked like it was from a book hundreds of years old, the letters themselves were as neat and tidy as if they had been printed. Seeing how both the location of Eden and the part expressing gratitude were scrawled, it meant she was in an extremely dangerous situation.<br><br>-Then it means she's being chased.<br><br>‘I think so too. Probably, she was caught while trying to gather more information after finding the main Eden base.’<br><br>It seemed that after Merlin had figured out that Eden was beneath the crater at the peak of White Peak Mountain, she was discovered by someone while trying to gather more information and was now on the run.<br><br>'If that wasn't the case, she would have come to find me directly, not sent a letter.'<br><br>Given Merlin's personality, if she wasn't being chased, she should have come to surprise him in the form of an animal. The fact that she sent only a letter, neither in her original form nor as an animal, confirmed that it was an extremely urgent situation.<br><br>'There's a possibility it could be a trap, but....'<br><br>He had to go anyway. As long as Merlin was in danger, he had to enter even if it was a trap. Raon gripped the edges of Merlin's letter tightly, crumpling the yellowed paper as if it might crumble.<br><br>'Thanking me for treating her like a person? I haven't done anything for you yet.'<br><br>From before, Merlin had always considered herself as something other than human. Unlike dragons who elevated themselves and viewed humans as insects, she rather thought of herself as a lower being and got along well with animals.<br><br>In the continent's history, Merlin was recorded as either a villainess who abandoned her position as the royal archmage and sided with monsters, or as someone who was devoured by a demon at birth and killed her parents on the spot. It seemed to be related to that.<br><br>'How pathetic.'<br><br>He should have helped treat her wounds when they were reopened. He deeply regretted not asking about Merlin's past, thinking it was for her own good.<br><br>'I'm really a damn bastard.'<br><br>He had received countless help from Merlin, but he hadn't done anything for her in return. He sneered at himself for being such a coward.<br><br>-You stupid fool!<br><br>Wrath furrowed his brows as if asking what he was doing.<br><br>'I know. This isn't the time to think about such things.'<br><br>Raon nodded while grinding his molars.<br><br>'It's just that I don't know what to do.'<br><br>Although he knew the location of Eden's main base, he couldn't figure out what to do or how to do it. There was no dimensional gate extending to near White Peak Mountain, so by the time he arrived there, everything would already be over. No, even if he could go to White Peak Mountain right now, there was no guarantee that Merlin would be there.<br><br>'Wrath.'<br><br>Raon looked at Wrath while exhaling a murky breath.<br><br>-Hmm...<br><br>Wrath shook his head with furrowed brows.<br><br>-Even this king can do nothing in the human world, unlike in the Devildom.<br><br>The fellow lowered his gaze, saying that all he could do was spread his aura perception when nearby.<br><br>'Then what should I do....'<br><br>Just as Raon was grinding his molars to the point of breaking, it happened.<br><br>"Palace Master?"<br><br>Mark Goetun approached his side.<br><br>"Are you alright?"<br><br>He had been watching Raon, his complexion darkened with concern.<br><br>"Ah, no. I'm..."<br><br>Raon was about to answer that he was fine when he swallowed dryly, seeing the entrance to the Lord's Manor floating behind Mark Goetun.<br><br>'The Lord's Manor....'<br><br>That's right. This is the only way now. Going by dimensional gate to near White Peak Mountain and then running would definitely be too late. Whether it worked or not, he had to borrow the power of Glenn and the other Four Kings.<br><br>"Burren, Martha, Runaan. Please guide these people to Mirtan Village."<br><br>Raon asked the three, saying he had something to do.<br><br>"What? What kind of..."<br><br>"Understood."<br><br>Burren nodded, cutting off Martha's words. He seemed to have instantly realized it was a serious matter.<br><br>"I'm sorry. I should be the one guiding you."<br><br>"Ah, no."<br><br>Latiru waved his hand, saying it was fine, as if he had read Raon's expression. Honestly, Raon didn't know what his face looked like right now.<br><br>"Then."<br><br>After politely apologizing to everyone, Raon entered the Lord's Manor again.<br><br>"I'll go with you."<br><br>Mark Goetun bowed his head, following behind Raon.<br><br>"No. I'll go alone."<br><br>Raon firmly waved his hand. If it were a family duty, he might understand, but this was his personal matter, and because the situation was urgent, he wanted to move alone.<br><br>"I am the Palace Master's guardian. Whether it's a personal matter or a family matter, it's my duty to follow. If I fall behind, you can leave me behind."<br><br>Mark Goetun bowed at the waist, saying Raon could leave him behind anytime, as if he had read Raon's thoughts.<br><br>"...Alright."<br><br>Raon let out a short sigh. He couldn't refuse because he had appointed Mark Goetun as a guardian to begin with.<br><br>"Let's hurry."<br><br>Raon ran towards the audience chamber, erasing the negative thoughts surfacing in his mind.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>"...That's how it turned out, and he's already caught an Ancient Dragon and returned. Isn't it admirable how he keeps his word?"<br><br>Glenn nodded slightly towards the blue window floating on the ceiling of the audience chamber.<br><br>"Who would have imagined that Raon would move faster than us! Moreover, he didn't just reduce the number of enemies! He also brought back a definite lead!"<br><br>He spread his arms wide, saying that this achievement wasn't just about catching a dragon. The corners of his mouth were raised to his ears, looking truly happy.<br><br>"Sigh..."<br><br>Chamber bit into a candy in the blue window.<br><br>"I thought something had happened when the emergency communication network was activated, but it was just bragging about your grandson? This is really driving me crazy."<br><br>She shrugged her shoulders, saying it was unbelievable.<br><br>"...But our Raon wasn't hurt, right?"<br><br>However, Chamber raised her eyebrows, seeming worried about Raon.<br><br>"At this rate, it wouldn't be strange to brag all day long! Accept it!"<br><br>Ogram applauded, saying it was amazing.<br><br>"By the way, where is the protagonist of this achievement? I want to see his face."<br><br>He rolled his eyes around in the blue window, as if wanting to see Raon.<br><br>"To make the Light Wind Palace kill an Ancient Dragon, the Light Wind Palace Master is not only a great martial artist but also has excellent talent as a commander."<br><br>King Lecross let out a dry laugh, saying that Raon seemed to have no shortcomings.<br><br>"Indeed, it's amazing. I want to see inside..."<br><br>Larian, the Mage Tower Master, muttered as if whispering that she wanted to see inside Raon. Her eyes sparkled strangely under her hood.<br><br>"Don't you dare think of anything weird."<br><br>Chamber bared her white teeth, warning Larian not to touch Raon.<br><br>"Th-That's not what I meant."<br><br>Larian slightly lowered her head, hiding her sparkling eyes.<br><br>"Head of House. What is the content of the clue about the Four Demons that was discovered?"<br><br>King Lecross licked his lips, saying that was what he was most curious about.<br><br>"Yes. Tell us. We need to prepare right away."<br><br>Ogram also rubbed his hands together, saying he should send shamans who could move secretly.<br><br>"The clue about the Four Demons that Raon brought is..."<br><br>Just as Glenn was about to speak with the corners of his mouth raised to his ears, it happened. The doors of the audience chamber opened roughly, and Raon and Mark Goetun entered.<br><br>"Raon...?"<br><br>Glenn widened his eyes at Raon's appearance, which was different from usual.<br><br>"Did Raon come?"<br><br>Chamber turned her head sharply as if about to jump out of the blue window.<br><br>"Suddenly?"<br><br>King Lecross also lowered his eyebrows, as if surprised.<br><br>"Raon!"<br><br>Ogram immediately waved his hand, as if glad to see him.<br><br>"I apologize for entering suddenly."<br><br>Raon bowed deeply to Glenn and the leaders of the Four Kings.<br><br>"I've found the location of Eden's main base."<br><br>Raon raised his gaze as he stepped forward towards the blue window.<br><br>"The location of Eden's main base?"<br><br>Glenn's jaw trembled as if he couldn't even imagine such a thing.<br><br>"Eden's main base is beneath the crater at the peak of White Peak Mountain. It will need investigation, but it's probably certain."<br><br>Raon bowed his head, saying he needed personnel who could move secretly to be dispatched.<br><br>"H-How did you find that out?"<br><br>Chamber blinked her eyes as if dumbfounded.<br><br>"Someone sent me information. That's why I have a favor to ask now."<br><br>Raon held out Merlin's letter towards Chamber.<br><br>"Is it possible for you to know where the person who sent me this letter is?"<br><br>There was no other way but to rely on Chamber now, even though he had never heard of or seen magic that could track the sender of an item.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Glenn turned his gaze to Chamber after looking at Raon's hardened expression.<br><br>"Is there such magic?"<br><br>"I'm an expert in spatial magic, but there's no such magic."<br><br>Chamber shook her head, saying she had never even thought about such a thing.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>Raon bit his lip until it bled as he watched Chamber's wavering gaze.<br><br>'Damn it....'<br><br>Was it just a waste of time? He regretted that he should have run to where there was a dimensional gate from the beginning.<br><br>"I understand. I'll..."<br><br>"Wait."<br><br>As Raon was about to turn around and leave on trembling legs, Chamber raised her hand.<br><br>"I can't do it, but there is someone who might be able to do such a perverted magic."<br><br>Chamber pointed her finger at Larian on the right side of the screen.<br><br>"Right?"<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Larian slowly raised her gaze to examine the letter in Raon's hand.<br><br>"W-Was it sent by magic?"<br><br>She wiggled her finger as if that was important.<br><br>"Yes. It fell on top of my head just a moment ago."<br><br>"I-I'll take it for a moment."<br><br>As Larian stretched out her hand, the letter that was in Raon's grasp appeared in her screen.<br><br>"Eden's main base. Beneath the crater at the peak of White Peak Mountain. And..."<br><br>Larian didn't read the words written on the back of the letter, just staring at it for a moment.<br><br>"Ah, there's a very faint trace of mana left. I think I can do it."<br><br>She nodded, saying that Merlin's mana remained because not much time had passed since the letter was sent.<br><br>"Really?"<br><br>His heart was beating so fast it felt like it might burst, as he hadn't had high expectations.<br><br>"I-I can do it, but there's a lot to prepare. It will take some time."<br><br>Larian slightly shook her hooded head, saying it was difficult but seemed possible.<br><br>"Please, I beg you. Tell me that location."<br><br>"I-I can even send you there."<br><br>She raised her hand, saying she could not only tell the location but also transport him to where the letter was sent from.<br><br>"B-But later..."<br><br>Larian's dazed eyes flashed with a chilling light.<br><br>"Can you grant me one favor?"<br><br>She nodded, saying if that was okay, she would send him somehow.<br><br>"Alright. Anything."<br><br>Raon nodded without the slightest hesitation.<br><br>"No! She's the least sane among us!"<br><br>Chamber shook her head, telling him to refuse immediately.<br><br>"She might even dissect you!"<br><br>"It's fine."<br><br>He didn't want to think about the consequences now. He had to go, even if it meant selling his soul to a demon or an angel.<br><br>"...It seems that child is being chased."<br><br>Glenn slightly lowered his eyebrows, as if realizing that Merlin was the one who sent the letter.<br><br>"I'd rather go myself. As long as I don't overdo it, it should be fine."<br><br>He rose from his throne as if to say he would go personally.<br><br>"N-No."<br><br>Larian parted her lips while lowering her gaze.<br><br>"Th-This magic can only send someone I can control."<br><br>She shook her head, saying she couldn't send Glenn because he was stronger than her. Hearing those words, Raon could roughly guess what kind of magic Larian was planning to use.<br><br>"Don't worry."<br><br>Raon shook his head, looking at Glenn.<br><br>"I absolutely won't try to storm Eden directly. I'll just rescue her and come right back."<br><br>He placed his hand on his sword hilt, asking Glenn to trust him.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Glenn kept moving his lips without giving permission, as if he was still worried.<br><br>"D-Don't worry."<br><br>Larian shook her head.<br><br>"I'm not sure of the exact location, but where this letter was sent from is not near White Peak Mountain."<br><br>She wiggled the hand holding her staff, saying it was far from White Peak Mountain.<br><br>"What concerns me more than anything else is that it could be a trap."<br><br>King Lecross narrowed his eyes, saying there was a possibility that the letter itself was a trap.<br><br>"Th-That should be fine too. I'll be watching."<br><br>Larian snapped her fingers, saying she would observe and immediately transport him back if it was dangerous. It seemed she wanted to absolutely secure the favor she had gained from Raon.<br><br>"Since she says so, please trust me just this once."<br><br>Raon bowed his head to Glenn, asking him to believe in him.<br><br>"Sigh, I can't help it."<br><br>Glenn let out a long sigh, as if realizing he couldn't stop Raon.<br><br>About 20 minutes later, Larian engraved a red magic circle on Merlin's letter that looked as if it had been drawn with blood.<br><br>"I-If you place your hand on the magic circle, you should be able to move to where the letter was sent from."<br><br>Larian licked her lips, saying he could depart right away.<br><br>"Such a perverted magic..."<br><br>Chamber shook her head, saying it was amazing but unbelievable.<br><br>"Then I'll be going."<br><br>Raon bowed to Glenn.<br><br>"If you've made your decision, bring her back no matter what."<br><br>Glenn lowered his heavy gaze towards Raon.<br><br>“Because I need to hear the word grandfather for the first time in a long time.”<br><br>He nodded, telling Raon to do it properly if he had made up his mind.<br><br>"Yes. I'll definitely bring her back."<br><br>Raon placed his hand on his chest as if making a vow.<br><br>"Let's go."<br><br>He spread out the letter with the magic circle engraved on it while placing his hand on Mark Goetun's shoulder.<br><br>"I-If there's a problem, call my name."<br><br>As Larian clasped her hands together, Merlin's letter tore into thousands of pieces and enveloped Raon and Mark Goetun. The white letter fragments that had been surrounding them burned black and faded away, and in that instant, Raon and Mark Goetun found themselves in a blackened forest instead of the audience chamber.<br><br>'We've already moved?'<br><br>He knew the Mage Tower Master's magic was mysterious, but he didn't expect it to be to this extent. He couldn't help but let out a dry laugh in disbelief.<br><br>-It seems we've been sent to the right place.<br><br>Wrath furrowed his brows as he looked at the blackened ground.<br><br>-I can sense that madwoman's mana in the surroundings.<br><br>The fellow lowered his gaze, saying Merlin had fought here.<br><br>'You're right. It's Merlin's mana.'<br><br>Raon nodded as he examined the trees that had turned to ash. Right after sending the letter, Merlin's mana flow had melted down chaotically, as if she had been attacked.<br><br>'However....'<br><br>He couldn't tell where Merlin was.<br><br>About 30 minutes had passed since Merlin sent him the letter. Given her speed and that of those pursuing her, they would be far from this forest by now.<br><br>'Wrath.'<br><br>-Even this king's perception can't catch her. It seems she has moved to a completely different place.<br><br>Wrath closed his eyes, as if still spreading his aura perception despite saying it was difficult to find her.<br><br>'Damn it....'<br><br>Raon operated the Ring of Fire and the Perception of the Snow Flower at their limits, even calling upon the emotions of the demon kings. As he endlessly spread his perception amidst pain that felt like his body and soul were being twisted, he heard a very small sound of space tearing from the far west.<br><br>-I've found her!<br><br>'I heard it too!'<br><br>Raon and Wrath turned their gaze towards the west without anyone needing to say anything.<br><br>"It's to the west!"<br><br>Raon told Mark Goetun to follow him and ran towards the west, crushing the earth beneath him.<br><br>"Yes!"<br><br>Mark Goetun gritted his teeth as he chased after Raon, who was advancing like a red beam of light.<br><br>'Even if I die, I'll follow!'</p>
