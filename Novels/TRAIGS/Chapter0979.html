        <p>"Hahahahaha!"<br><br>Ogram burst into thunderous laughter that seemed to shake the ground as he looked up at Raon.<br><br>"As expected of Raon! To succeed in such an impossible task!"<br><br>He nodded emphatically, acknowledging that the outcome had exceeded his expectations.<br><br>"Well..."<br><br>King Lecross let out a sigh as he observed the revitalized capital.<br><br>"To think he'd truly restore everyone's minds."<br><br>He examined each person who had regained their original gaze, his chin trembling slightly.<br><br>"That's not all."<br><br>Xanthos swallowed dryly as he placed a hand to his ear.<br><br>"He said he'd save those enchanted by the Archangel, but instead he made them praise him. I never thought such a thing was possible..."<br><br>He blinked in astonishment as he watched the people of Balkar singing Wrath's hymn of praise.<br><br>"How is this even possible?"<br><br>Xanthos wrinkled his nose, unable to believe what he was seeing despite witnessing it firsthand.<br><br>"It's hard to believe even when seeing it."<br><br>Chamber smiled faintly in agreement.<br><br>"I couldn't imagine those childish lyrics becoming such soul-stirring music either."<br><br>She nodded, admitting that while the lyrics were still childish, the melody made her want to sing along.<br><br>"To think this is possible without magic, I want to... dissect..."<br><br>Larian licked her lips eerily, clasping her hands together as if she meant every word.<br><br>"Huh...?"<br><br>"What did you just say...?"<br><br>Ogram and King Lecross turned to look at Larian with surprised eyes.<br><br>"This crazy woman is really..."<br><br>Chamber bit her lip, exasperated.<br><br>"You know you'll die too if you touch them, right?"<br><br>She bared her teeth, which were clenching a candy, warning Larian not to even think about it.<br><br>"N-no, the song. I meant the song, not the people..."<br><br>Larian shook her head, explaining that she wanted to dissect the song that broke Raphael's enchantment and instead invigorated people.<br><br>"Ahem!"<br><br>Glenn wore a long smile, his trembling lips betraying his joy at Raon's accomplishments, regardless of what others were saying. He looked every bit the doting grandfather.<br><br>"See, I told you he'd come through if we believed in him."<br><br>Burren brushed off his hands, claiming he hadn't doubted for a second.<br><br>"But I don't want to sing that song..."<br><br>Martha shook her head, saying she'd rather die than sing that song herself.<br><br>"Me neither..."<br><br>Runaan squeezed her eyes shut, agreeing that the song was too much for her. It had been a long time since these two, who usually fought at the slightest provocation, had seen eye to eye.<br><br>"I've served Lord Raon for a long time, but that song is a bit..."<br><br>Even Dorian couldn't bring himself to sing Wrath's hymn of praise, pulling out earplugs from his pouch to block his ears.<br><br>"It seems this will definitely be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of thing."<br><br>Even Mark Goetun, who regarded Raon as a mentor, let out a low groan.<br><br>"Huh? Isn't the song good? The more I listen, the better the lyrics sound."<br><br>Krein tilted his head, saying both the song and lyrics had grown on him.<br><br>"..."<br><br>The swordsmen of the Light Wind Palace blinked in confusion as Krein, who usually defied Raon the most, honestly admitted to liking the song.<br><br>"...I don't think I can stay like this either."<br><br>Ogram clenched his fist, his eyes filled with solemnity.<br><br>"What do you mean by that?"<br><br>King Lecross narrowed his eyes as he looked at Ogram.<br><br>"Raon is going all out for the Five Kings. He did during the Black Tower war, and he's doing it again today. But I've been leisurely recovering my strength, using danger as an excuse."<br><br>Ogram slapped his own cheek as if disgusted with himself.<br><br>"I'm going to do whatever it takes to regain my martial prowess. We can't keep relying on that young one to lead the way forever."<br><br>He bit his lip, saying he would try various experiments, even if it meant using magic that would shock his soul.<br><br>"'Don't do such a thing and stay put!' is what I want to say, but..."<br><br>Chamber shook her head, chewing on the candy in her mouth.<br><br>"I can't say that. I've been thinking something similar."<br><br>She ground her molars, saying she couldn't waste time idly when Raon was putting in so much effort to create such songs.<br><br>"I'll try to erase the wounds in my upper dantian as quickly as possible. I'll even look into alchemy if I have to. I don't want to see Raon die."<br><br>Chamber nodded, saying she wanted to recover her strength not for her own life, but for Raon's sake.<br><br>"So, you help too."<br><br>She jerked her chin towards Larian.<br><br>"Are you really asking me for help?"<br><br>Larian's eyes widened in surprise.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Chamber let out a short sigh and lowered her eyebrows.<br><br>"Then it's not my responsibility if you die, right?"<br><br>Larian curled her red lips, her eyes gleaming coldly. It seemed her personality had changed again at the prospect of something interesting.<br><br>"Sword Emperor Raon Zieghart. I thought it might be too early for such a title, but now it seems inadequate. His caliber is different from anyone I've seen before."<br><br>Xanthos nodded, admitting he had no choice but to acknowledge Raon.<br><br>"Ahem!"<br><br>Glenn covered his mouth and cleared his throat repeatedly, seemingly proud of Raon for changing even the Five Kings' minds. However, he couldn't hide his flushed cheeks and earlobes that seemed about to burst.<br><br>"You seem quite pleased."<br><br>"It seems Young Master Raon is truly the one who brings the Head of House the most joy."<br><br>Sheryl and Roenn smiled faintly at the sight. While the majestic military song echoed throughout the capital, warm laughter and firm convictions were blossoming beneath the royal palace.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>-Damn it!<br><br>'Be quiet.'<br><br>Raon pushed back the cursing Wrath and checked the messages again.<br><br>[The Demon King's hymn has spread across the continent.]<br><br>[All abilities increase by 20 points.]<br><br>[The military song has been created.]<br><br>[The rank of the trait has increased.]<br><br>[The rank of the trait has increased.]<br><br>‘Not just all stats, but Authority Manipulation and Light Attribute Resistance have also increased.’<br><br>Was it because he erased Raphael's divine power? It seemed those two traits had increased in rank because he used Wrath's authority to erase Raphael's divine power.<br><br>'Shall we look at the contents of Praise of the Demon King?<br><br> A song praising the Demon King of Wrath. Originally a childish tune that no one sang, it was revived as a powerful military song thanks to a singer and director with once-in-a-generation talent. Those who sing the song in front of the Demon King of Wrath gain resistance to divine power for an hour, and their physical and mental abilities also increase.<br><br>'Huh...'<br><br>Raon let out a dry laugh after reading the description of the military song .<br><br>'Is this for real?'<br><br>In reality, singing a military song might boost morale a bit, but it doesn't cause physical changes. However, Praise of the Demon King actually enhanced physical and mental abilities, and even created resistance to holy power.<br><br>'And for a whole hour at that.'<br><br>Although there was the limitation of having to sing in front of Wrath, the fact that it lasted for an hour was an absurdly overpowered ability.<br><br>-A childish song that no one sings? This bastard, really!<br><br>Wrath ground his teeth audibly as he read the first paragraph of Praise of the Demon King.<br><br>'Calm down. It's saying your song is good in the end.'<br><br>Raon patted Wrath's head, which had turned bright red.<br><br>-Grr...<br><br>Wrath let out a low groan, clutching his head.<br><br>-W-well, at least the ability is fitting for a song praising me. If that had been terrible too, I would have really gone after you!<br><br>He seemed to like the part about the song making not just himself, but all of the Light Wind Palace stronger.<br><br>-Sigh, I feel strange.<br><br>Wrath shook his head, saying he felt both good and bad.<br><br>'I'm sure you do.'<br><br>Raon nodded with a smirk.<br><br>'You like that your song is being sung and the Light Wind Palace members are getting stronger, but you don't like that I'm getting rewards... huh?'<br><br>He narrowed his eyes as he waved his hand towards Wrath.<br><br>'What's this?'<br><br>As people sang along with Yua and Olga's song, he felt his soul ripple greatly. It wasn't just due to the effect of the military song.<br><br>'No way...'<br><br>Was his soul's rank growing? As people sang Praise of the Demon King, his soul's rank was rising, and his mental world was expanding. It wasn't expanding greatly, but his soul was growing little by little.<br><br>'Could it be...'<br><br>Raon swallowed dryly as he looked down at the capital.<br><br>'Is this an effect of people singing Wrath's hymn?'<br><br>Thinking about it, there was no other reason. Wrath's hymn was affecting this world, causing his soul and mental image to grow.<br><br>-Nooooo!<br><br>Wrath, seemingly feeling his own changes now, rushed forward.<br><br>-Why is your soul growing when they're praising me!<br><br>He yelled that it didn't make any sense.<br><br>-This damn... Huh?<br><br>Wrath, who had been grinding his teeth so hard they might break, suddenly opened his eyes wide.<br><br>-I-it's coming to me too!<br><br>He nodded, saying that the emotions conveyed through Praise of the Demon King were reaching his soul as well.<br><br>-Yes. This is how it should be! This is right!<br><br>Wrath nodded vigorously, insisting that it was right for him to become stronger.<br><br>'Hmm, but it seems like I'm getting more of it?'<br><br>Raon shook his head as he compared the rank transmitted to Wrath with what he himself gained.<br><br>-That's what I'm saying! Why are you getting more of it? No, the fact that you're getting any at all doesn't make sense!<br><br>Wrath furrowed his brow, demanding to know why Raon was benefiting from a song praising him.<br><br>'Is it because I'm your master, so we share the benefits?'<br><br>-Who's my master? You crazy human!<br><br>'Well, I do feed you...'<br><br>-Shut up!<br><br>He growled, telling Raon to stop talking nonsense.<br><br>'I'm just kidding.'<br><br>Raon shook his head as he read the description of Praise of the Demon King again.<br><br>'It's probably because I acted as the medium to convey your song. Honestly, it was a song no one was singing before.'<br><br>-Hmm...<br><br>Wrath averted his eyes, as if unable to refute that point.<br><br>-It's true that without you, such a song wouldn't have been created.<br><br>He nodded, acknowledging this fact.<br><br>'It's not just me. Without those two, we couldn't have even attempted it.'<br><br>Raon bowed his head to Olga and Yua, who were slowly opening their eyes after finishing the song. Even though the two had stopped singing, Praise of the Demon King continued to echo throughout the capital, nurturing his soul.<br><br>If Yua and Olga hadn't participated, he would never have received such a reward. He sent a heartfelt thanks from deep within.<br><br>-You say that, but you'll probably just let it pass without saying anything.<br><br>Wrath snorted, claiming he could see right through Raon.<br><br>'Of course I'll give them a reward.'<br><br>Raon shook his head with a smile.<br><br>'Whatever they want.'<br><br>He applauded Yua and Olga as they returned, vowing to grant them whatever they truly desired.<br><br>"Young Master!"<br><br>Yua grinned, as if asking if she had done well.<br><br>"Ugh!"<br><br>On the other hand, Olga ground her teeth, her complexion deathly pale.<br><br>"Just let me hit you."<br><br>She charged at him with a yell, as if reverting to her former self as the troublemaker saintess.<br><br>'Huh?'<br><br>-Don't dodge!<br><br>As Raon tried to dodge, Wrath twisted his lips into a smirk.<br><br>-You said you'd grant their wish!<br><br>Wrath shook his head, gesturing for Raon to stop.<br><br>-Just take the hit, you bastard!<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>After erasing all traces of Raphael's divine power from the Balkar capital, Raon descended from the tower.<br><br>"It's all done. After a day's rest, everyone should be fine."<br><br>Raon waved his hand, saying there was no need to worry anymore.<br><br>"Good job! Well done!"<br><br>"The results are better than expected. I didn't think you could heal everyone at once."<br><br>Ogram and Lecross nodded.<br><br>"There's really nothing you can't do. Are you sure you're not a magician?"<br><br>Chamber let out a dry laugh, tapping her arm in disbelief.<br><br>"C-can I record the song?"<br><br>Larian licked her lips, asking if she could hear the song one more time.<br><br>"I'm sorry, but if I do it one more time, I might die."<br><br>Raon shrugged, pointing to his forehead and eyelids where Olga's fist marks remained.<br><br>"Well done."<br><br>Glenn, seemingly extremely excited, grabbed Raon's shoulders with a trembling voice. His hands were shaking too.<br><br>"It's nothing."<br><br>Raon shook his head, saying it wasn't him but Yua and Olga's power.<br><br>"Now we can really enjoy the festival."<br><br>Chamber took out a new candy, suggesting they enjoy the festival until tomorrow and then end it.<br><br>"I'm sorry, but we need to leave first."<br><br>Raon raised his hand, shaking his head.<br><br>"Someone I know said they found a dragon, so we need to go back first."<br><br>He nodded, saying an urgent letter had come from Zieghart.<br><br>"Already?"<br><br>"So quickly?"<br><br>"We haven't found anything in the black market yet."<br><br>The leaders of the Five Kings widened their eyes in disbelief.<br><br>"Yes. If we didn't know, we couldn't help it, but now that we do, we need to move right away."<br><br>Raon waved his hand, saying they didn't have much time.<br><br>"Now I think I understand how you became so strong at such a young age."<br><br>Xanthos smiled faintly, saying he now understood Raon's martial prowess and achievements.<br><br>"Alright. I understand."<br><br>King Lecross patted his own shoulder, acknowledging Raon's hard work.<br><br>"Next time we meet, I'll return as an adult you won't be ashamed of."<br><br>He waved his hand, saying they'd meet again after he fully recovered from his injuries.<br><br>"I'll come out too, after I've erased all of this damned curse."<br><br>Ogram flashed a refreshing smile, saying they'd meet again if he didn't die.<br><br>"Right. This is where I stop showing my pathetic side to my junior."<br><br>Chamber nodded heavily, as if she had been in deep thought.<br><br>"Next time we meet, it'll be after I've erased all the wounds in my upper dantian."<br><br>She also clenched her small fist, determined to recover her strength somehow.<br><br>"I'll be counting on you."<br><br>Raon smiled and bowed to the leaders of the Five Kings. He felt a little happy that his actions had influenced them.<br><br>"I'll stay. I need to be here until the event ends."<br><br>Glenn nodded, telling them to go ahead. He wore a long smile, his cheeks flushed red as if in a very good mood.<br><br>"It's a shame, but I'll have to send you right away."<br><br>As Chamber snapped her fingers, a blue-tinged dimensional gate opened, just like when they came here from the Lord's Manor.<br><br>"If you enter that, you'll come out at the Lord's Manor."<br><br>She waved her hand, saying they'd see each other next time.<br><br>"Yes. Well then."<br><br>Raon bowed once more to the leaders of the Five Kings, then jerked his chin at the swordsmen of the Light Wind Palace.<br><br>"Let's go."<br><br>"Yes!"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen followed him towards the dimensional gate, their eyes filled with pride for Zieghart.<br><br>'...'<br><br>Raon turned to look back before entering the dimensional gate.<br><br>'By now, the news should have reached you. I wonder what kind of face you're making?'<br><br>He looked up at the sky of Balkar where Archangel Raphael had descended, twisting his lips into a smile.<br><br>'Derus Robert.'</p>
