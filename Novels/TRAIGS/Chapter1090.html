        <p>"One month..."<br><br>The Warlord stepped forward while steadying his wavering gaze.<br><br>"While it's true that Lord Raon's talent and martial prowess have astonished us, one month is an extremely short time."<br><br>He shook his head, saying that one month would be impossible regardless of one's talent.<br><br>"We'll see about that after a month has passed. Shall we make a small wager?"<br><br>Raon lowered the Heavenly Drive with a light smile.<br><br>"I'm confident."<br><br>This wasn't bravado or desperation due to time constraints. He was certain he could succeed, as he had never been wrong about such judgments before.<br><br>"Very well. Let's make it so the winner gets to make a small wish."<br><br>The Warlord nodded slightly and raised the Sword of Cold Severity.<br><br>"Then I shall now teach you the Devil-Fighting Sword Art."<br><br>Without saying he wouldn't teach or commenting on any presumption, he went straight into the lesson. Despite his cold judgment earlier, it seemed he had firmly decided to follow Raon.<br><br>"Unlike the Devil-Cutting Blade Art, the Devil-Fighting Sword Art is a cruel martial art that uses water-attributed aura to slash enemies and freeze their wounds until they burst."<br><br>The Warlord lowered his chin as he explained that the Devil-Fighting Sword Art was the opposite of the Devil-Cutting Blade Art.<br><br>-Oh ho!<br><br>Wrath clapped his hands and exclaimed in admiration.<br><br>-That guy knows his stuff! Wounds are best burst with cold energy! They can't even regenerate due to frostbite!<br><br>His eyes sparkled as he suddenly took a liking to the Warlord.<br><br>"The Devil-Fighting Sword Art is slow and heavy, yet smooth and flexible. It also incorporates the principles of the severing sword, making it useful for countering enemy martial arts."<br><br>The Warlord demonstrated, displaying sword techniques that flowed like water.<br><br>"However, it has one thing in common with the Devil-Cutting Blade Art."<br><br>He looked at Raon as if asking whether he knew what it was.<br><br>"The Crushing Sword."<br><br>Raon nodded while looking at the Blade Queen.<br><br>"Both the Devil-Cutting Blade Art and the Devil-Fighting Sword Art contain the principles of the Crushing Sword."<br><br>The Sword and Saber Sovereign had incorporated the principles of the Crushing Sword into both the Devil-Cutting Blade Art and the Devil-Fighting Sword Art to create an overwhelming power that could not be defeated by any martial art. He too was a great master and an absolute martial artist who could reach the heavens.<br><br>"Wow, you sensed that too?"<br><br>The Blade Queen's jaw dropped.<br><br>"You keep surprising me no matter how many times I watch you."<br><br>She let out a bemused laugh, saying it was becoming truly remarkable.<br><br>"...That's correct."<br><br>The Warlord nodded while his eyes trembled slightly.<br><br>"Both the Devil-Fighting Sword Art and the Devil-Cutting Blade Art contain the principles of the Crushing Sword. As you know, this is because they were martial arts that the Sword and Saber Sovereign used simultaneously."<br><br>He raised his sword, explaining that since the Sword and Saber Sovereign used both sword and sabre simultaneously, they inevitably shared similar underlying principles.<br><br>"Please observe my sword technique first."<br><br>The Warlord brought down his raised sword with an almost tediously slow motion. His technique fell in an elegant arc like swordsmanship, splitting the black sea in half. With a whoosh, the Warlord demonstrated all the forms of the Devil-Fighting Sword Art, cold sweat appearing on his brow from his intense concentration.<br><br>"Whew..."<br><br>He stepped back after freezing the surrounding sea completely white.<br><br>"This is the Devil-Fighting Sword Art. Do you have any questions?"<br><br>The Warlord looked at Raon with eyes filled with subtle anticipation as he offered to take questions.<br><br>"In the first form, you slowed down the sword strike before suddenly accelerating again - that was to break through the enemy's weak point, wasn't it?"<br><br>Raon spoke slowly while recalling the first form the Warlord had shown.<br><br>"Y-yes, that's right!"<br><br>The Warlord stood there blankly before nodding.<br><br>"That form was developed specifically to block and counter the Devil-Cutting Blade Art - you could see that?"<br><br>The Blade Queen muttered in disbelief as her eyes widened.<br><br>"For the second form where you cut diagonally upward, wouldn't it be better to increase the angle to add more weight to the strike?"<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he demonstrated the form of the Devil-Fighting Sword Art.<br><br>"That's a good observation. However, doing so would slow down the transition to the third form. While the Devil-Fighting Sword Art is slow, as a severing sword technique, the connections between forms must be perfect and swift."<br><br>The Warlord shook his head, explaining that one must consider not just individual forms but their connections as well. His eyes began to shine even more.<br><br>"Wouldn't it work if we do it like this? If we extend the sword a bit more forward..."<br><br>"Hmm, that looks promising. It's certainly worth experimenting with."<br><br>The Warlord's heavy voice suddenly rose by two octaves.<br><br>"And the fifth form's weight seems a bit..."<br><br>"That's a good point. For that part..."<br><br>"For the tenth form, rather than moving slowly..."<br><br>"Let's try it out!"<br><br>Raon and the Warlord huddled together like they were sharing a campfire, discussing the Devil-Fighting Sword Art at length. Two hours later, the Warlord extended his hand to Raon first.<br><br>"One month..."<br><br>He nodded with a warm smile that seemed out of place on his cold features.<br><br>"Let's do it."<br><br>***<br><br>The flames rising from the Heavenly Drive created brilliant flashes that set the northern skies ablaze, while frost emanating from the Wooden Ring Sword released frigid energy waves that froze the pitch-black Northern Sea like a shadow. <br><br>The Devil-Cutting Blade Art and the Devil-Fighting Sword Art - the absolute techniques of the Sword and Saber Sovereign from a thousand years ago were manifesting in Raon's hands.<br><br>"This is absolutely insane."<br><br>The Blade Queen let out a breath as she watched Raon demonstrate the Devil-Cutting Blade Art.<br><br>"The flaws in his swordsmanship are disappearing rapidly. To think such a monster existed in this world..."<br><br>She exhaled in amazement, saying she now understood why Raon was so strong despite not yet being thirty.<br><br>"He's beyond genius. That's a demon's talent. It's a cruel power that cuts away the hopes and dreams of those around him."<br><br>The Warlord's lips trembled as he said he could hardly believe what he was seeing.<br><br>"If this talent had fallen into the hands of an evil person, this entire continent might have ended up under one person's control..."<br><br>He nodded, saying Raon's talent was enough to shake the entire continent and then some.<br><br>"So, what do you think? Can he do it within a month?"<br><br>The Blade Queen muttered curiously as she nudged the Warlord with her elbow.<br><br>"...I'm not sure about that."<br><br>The Warlord narrowed his eyes.<br><br>"It seems possible, but he might need a few more days."<br><br>He shook his head, saying that even with Raon's talent, one month wouldn't be easy.<br><br>"As you know, both the Devil-Fighting Sword Art and Devil-Cutting Blade Art are supreme martial arts. And on top of that..."<br><br>The Warlord briefly smacked his lips.<br><br>"He also needs to master the intermediate level of the Diamond Earth Technique. Even for Lord Raon, it's not something that can be done unconditionally."<br><br>He nodded, saying the chances of success were fifty-fifty.<br><br>[I hope he fails...]<br><br>The Gold Dragon Paratheus shook his head.<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>The Blade Queen raised her eyebrows as she looked at Paratheus.<br><br>[That human needs to taste failure for once! It's irritating how everything goes well for him!]<br><br>Paratheus furrowed his brow, seemingly annoyed by Raon's excellence.<br><br>"Now you're jealous of a human."<br><br>The Blade Queen shook her head in disbelief.<br><br>"No matter how you look at it, that one really shouldn't have been born a dragon."<br><br>"I agree."<br><br>The Warlord let out a deep sigh.<br><br>[No, even the Lord warned us to be careful of him! Said he's almost on the same level as Glenn Zieghart!]<br><br>Paratheus shook his head, saying that Raon and Glenn's threat levels were nearly identical.<br><br>"You're not on the dragons' side anymore. Don't worry about such things."<br><br>The Blade Queen waved her hand, telling him to stay quiet.<br><br>[W-well, that's true, but I'm still worried...]<br><br>Paratheus heaved a deep sigh.<br><br>"Think positively. If we win, you'll be the Lord. The Dragon Lord!"<br><br>The Blade Queen grinned, asking if that wouldn't be nice.<br><br>[D-does it work like that?]<br><br>Paratheus blinked his eyes, which were as large as glaciers.<br><br>[That's not bad at all? Actually, the Lord doesn't really do much! Just calls everyone now and then to show off!]<br><br>He grinned at this change in perspective. Unlike a typical dragon, he seemed to have a desire for honor.<br><br>"But if you become the Dragon Lord..."<br><br>The Warlord exhaled softly as he looked at Paratheus.<br><br>"Won't you have no one under you?"<br><br>[Uh...?]<br><br>***<br><br>"Whew..."<br><br>Raon planted the Heavenly Drive and the Wooden Ring Sword in the glacier before sitting down on the ground.<br><br>'Not bad.'<br><br>Because the Sword and Saber Sovereign had passed on not just the martial arts but also the mental principles, his growth rate was astonishingly fast. At his current rate, he might just barely make the one-month deadline.<br><br>'Plus, the Diamond Earth Technique is progressing well too.'<br><br>Using the Diamond Earth Technique methods learned from the Blade Queen and Warlord, he could develop his earth aura while using both the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation and Glacier. Thanks to this, the Diamond Earth Technique was developing according to plan.<br><br>-Damn it...<br><br>Wrath ground his teeth.<br><br>-I wanted him to fail no matter what!<br><br>'It is a bit uncertain though. Maybe I should have said two months?'<br><br>Although his growth was fast, trying to complete two years' worth of training in one month felt like it was putting a strain even on him. If he took even a slightly wrong path, he might fail.<br><br>-Hmph! Even if not this time, soon enough that big mouth of yours will get you in trouble.<br><br>Wrath wrinkled his nose, warning that Raon should watch what he says.<br><br>'You've been saying that since my trainee days, but when exactly is it going to be a problem?'<br><br>-W-well...<br><br>The guy seemed to have nothing to say and quickly turned his eyes away.<br><br>'Whatever else happens, there won't be any problems because of my tongue, so don't worry.'<br><br>Raon smirked as he showed off his title of .<br><br>"Lord Raon."<br><br>The Warlord approached from the side and bowed his head.<br><br>"Shall we begin right away?"<br><br>Raon raised his head while dusting off his hands.<br><br>"Actually, I came to ask you something I'm curious about."<br><br>The Blade Queen sat down beside him with a smile.<br><br>"How and where did you obtain the Sword and Saber Sovereign's martial arts?"<br><br>She lowered her hand, saying she had wanted to ask earlier but couldn't due to the urgent situation.<br><br>"Ah, right. I should have mentioned that first."<br><br>Raon smiled and straightened his back.<br><br>"It's not a difficult story to tell, so I'll explain right away. It started with rumors about the discovery of the Sword and Saber Sovereign's tomb. We weren't actually assigned to that mission..."<br><br>"T-the Sword and Saber Sovereign's tomb?"<br><br>"When was this?"<br><br>The Warlord and Blade Queen widened their eyes, saying they hadn't heard anything about it.<br><br>"It was quite a while ago. Back when we were in the Light Wind division."<br><br>"Why didn't we know about this?"<br><br>"I don't know either."<br><br>The Blade Queen and Warlord tilted their heads in confusion.<br><br>[That was when you two were fighting on that deserted island, shouting about dying together. Wouldn't it be stranger if you had heard about the Sword and Saber Sovereign while doing that?]<br><br>The Gold Dragon frowned in exasperation.<br><br>"Ah, was it then?"<br><br>"I see..."<br><br>The Blade Queen and Warlord nodded in understanding.<br><br>"A deserted island..."<br><br>Raon clicked his tongue, thinking that the Blade Queen and Warlord were indeed not normal.<br><br>"Please continue."<br><br>The Warlord clasped his hands together as he made his request.<br><br>"Ah, yes. Then..."<br><br>Raon explained how he had entered the Sword and Saber Sovereign's tomb, which turned out to be Zieghart's training ground, and how he had briefly met the Sword and Saber Sovereign and received his martial arts.<br><br>"...And that's how it led to now. I find it quite amazing myself."<br><br>As he smiled while speaking about this remarkable connection, the Blade Queen and Warlord silently stood up and positioned themselves before him.<br><br>"We pay our respects to the true successor of the Sword and Saber Sovereign!"<br><br>"We pay our respects to the true successor of the Sword and Saber Sovereign!"<br><br>The two people knelt down again and bowed their heads. He couldn't understand why they were so quick to bend their knees.<br><br>"After hearing this, it's certain."<br><br>"Indeed. Lord Raon is truly the Sword and Saber Sovereign's legitimate successor."<br><br>The Blade Queen and Warlord pressed their foreheads to the ground, saying it was only natural for him to be the successor since he had received direct recognition from the Sword and Saber Sovereign.<br><br>"Please don't do this! Wait until everything is finished."<br><br>Raon grabbed their shoulders and forcibly lifted the Blade Queen and Warlord up.<br><br>"Both of you said you would acknowledge me after I mastered the Sword and Saber Sovereign's martial arts. Please stick to that!"<br><br>While he did want their help, he didn't want to see people so much older than him kneeling like this.<br><br>"Understood."<br><br>"If that's what you say..."<br><br>The Blade Queen and Warlord slowly nodded and stood up.<br><br>"Ah, and..."<br><br>Raon extended his hand toward the two of them.<br><br>"I'll teach you the mantras for the Diamond Earth Technique, Devil-Fighting Sword Art, and Devil-Cutting Blade Art that I know. After all, you two are the true masters."<br><br>Since these were originally the martial arts of the sword and sabre schools, and since they would play major roles in the final war, it seemed appropriate to pass on the Sword and Saber Sovereign's martial arts to them.<br><br>"Train with me for one month."<br><br>Raon smiled and extended his hands to the Blade Queen and Warlord.<br><br>"L-Lord Raon..."<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>The Blade Queen and Warlord looked at him with moved expressions. This was a much better reaction than their kneeling from earlier.<br><br>"Now then, let's begin the transmission..."<br><br>"We pay our respects to the great successor of the Sword and Saber Sovereign!"<br><br>"We pay our respects to the true successor of the Sword and Saber Sovereign."<br><br>The two of them shattered his expectations by kneeling down and bowing their heads again.<br><br>"Oh come on..."<br><br>***<br><br>"Thank you for teaching us all this time."<br><br>Raon bowed his head before the cold-eyed Warlord and the warm Blade Queen.<br><br>"I am deeply indebted to you for this past month."<br><br>The Blade Queen and Warlord had truly stuck by his side for the entire month, helping him train in the Devil-Fighting Sword Art and Devil-Cutting Blade Art. <br><br>He was moved by how they kept their promise until the end, even though they must have been eager to train themselves with the perfected Diamond Earth Technique and martial arts they had received. <br><br>Now he understood why these two were still spoken of as Transcendents.<br><br>"No. I enjoyed it more."<br><br>The Blade Queen shook her head with warm eyes.<br><br>"I think I understand now why people raise disciples."<br><br>She smiled brightly, saying she should find and raise a disciple similar to Raon.<br><br>-That's not good.<br><br>Wrath deeply furrowed his brows.<br><br>-After teaching you, teaching anyone else will surely be frustrating, even if they're a genius!<br><br>He shook his head, saying it was like looking at the sky instead of the peak before even starting to climb.<br><br>"I feel the same way."<br><br>The Warlord smiled with a warmth that pierced through his usual coldness.<br><br>"I never knew discussing martial arts with Lord Raon would be so enjoyable."<br><br>He lightly smacked his lips as if wanting to continue such discussions in the future.<br><br>"We can do that anytime, so don't worry."<br><br>Raon shook his head with a slight smile.<br><br>"And since I received your teachings, that makes me your disciple too, right?"<br><br>He nodded to the Blade Queen as well.<br><br>"Honey! Let's have a child!"<br><br>The Blade Queen grabbed the Warlord's arm and shook it.<br><br>"I want to have a son or daughter like him! Really!"<br><br>She shook her head, saying she couldn't hold back anymore.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>The Warlord seemed to share the same thought as he gazed at the Blade Queen with gentle eyes.<br><br>[All of a sudden...?]<br><br>Gold Dragon Paratheus shook his head in disbelief.<br><br>-What’s going on with them?!<br><br>Wrath bared his teeth as if wondering what was wrong with them.<br><br>-Why are you surrounded by nothing but crazy people!<br><br>He shook his head, wondering how Raon managed to attract only crazy people.<br><br>"Save the marital discussion for later..."<br><br>Raon approached the Blade Queen and Warlord while placing his hands on the Heavenly Drive and Wooden Ring Sword.<br><br>"Now let's confirm whether I'm someone you can follow or not."<br><br>Raon raised his chin, saying it was time for the test.<br><br>"Of course!"<br><br>"We will judge objectively."<br><br>The Blade Queen and Warlord's flushed expressions disappeared as if they had never smiled, and they looked at Raon with cool eyes.<br><br>"Then..."<br><br>Raon drew the Heavenly Drive and Wooden Ring Sword. Brilliant flames and frost rose above the churning waves of the Northern Sea beneath a dark sky illuminated by a bright sun.<br><br>"I will begin."</p>
