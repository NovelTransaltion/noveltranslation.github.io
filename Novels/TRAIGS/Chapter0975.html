        <p>"Raphael...?"<br><br>Raon bit his lip as he observed the woman standing in the sky, overlooking everything.<br><br>'Was she really an Archangel?'<br><br>From the moment the pillar of holy light descended, he knew the blonde, blue-eyed woman at its center wasn't human.<br><br>He thought she might be an Angel, but he never expected an Archangel, let alone one of the seven.<br><br>'Come to think of it, her aura is similar to Uriel's.'<br><br>The Uriel summoned by Derus and the Raphael descending from the heavens emanated a similar aura. It seemed to be a characteristic of Angels.<br><br>'Wrath.'<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he turned his gaze to Wrath.<br><br>'That woman...'<br><br>-The troublemaker's words are correct.<br><br>Wrath deeply furrowed his brow as he looked up at Archangel Raphael.<br><br>-I don't even need to see her with my eyes. I can tell it's Raphael just by that repulsive aura.<br><br>He gritted his teeth, expressing his dislike.<br><br>'Why did an Archangel suddenly descend here?'<br><br>Raon lowered his chin, his hand resting on the hilt of the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>'It would have been better to keep her identity hidden.'<br><br>He could tell without looking who had summoned Archangel Raphael to the mortal realm.<br><br>'Derus Robert.'<br><br>It was clear that the damned bastard had summoned Raphael, just like he did with Uriel. However, he couldn't understand why such an important card was revealed openly instead of being kept hidden, especially when their forces were at a disadvantage.<br><br>-Tsk.<br><br>Wrath clicked his tongue deeply as he examined Raphael.<br><br>-That's not her true form.<br><br>'Not her true form? Raphael's?'<br><br>Raon turned to Wrath with wide eyes.<br><br>-That's right. Her real self isn't here.<br><br>He shook his head, insisting that this wasn't Raphael's true form.<br><br>'That's impossible...'<br><br>Raon exhaled sharply as he looked back at Raphael.<br><br>'To possess such an immense aura, yet not be the real thing...'<br><br>The aura emanating from Archangel Raphael now was above the level of a Five Kings leader. While not quite at Glenn's level, it felt similar to or even stronger than Chamber at her peak. It was hard to believe that this state was fake.<br><br>-Rather than fake, it's her authority. It's better to think of it as an avatar.<br><br>Wrath shook his head, explaining that it was an ability to imbue an avatar with the powers of the original.<br><br>-As the Archangel of Healing, Raphael could use avatars imbued with her original power to heal Angels on various battlefields.<br><br>He bit his lip, calling it a despicable ability.<br><br>'An avatar with the power of the original...'<br><br>While it seemed like an absurd ability, it made sense given her role as the Archangel of Healing.<br><br>'Then why did Raphael come here?'<br><br>Raon asked, licking his lips.<br><br>-How would I know that!<br><br>Wrath lowered one eyebrow, as if asking why he was being questioned about this.<br><br>'You don't know? You seemed to know everything else.'<br><br>-Hmm...<br><br>He let out a low groan as he looked up at Raphael. It seemed he truly didn't know anything.<br><br>'If you don't know, at least explain about Raphael.'<br><br>Raon nodded at Wrath.<br><br>-Raphael is known for being the most insidious among the Angels. She approaches under the guise of healing, only to steal what's most precious to you.<br><br>'Isn't that what demons do?'<br><br>Raphael's actions, as described by Wrath, sounded exactly like those of demons in fairy tales.<br><br>-Exactly!<br><br>Wrath clenched his fist audibly.<br><br>-This cursed continent blames us for everything the Angels do! These humans with their twisted perceptions!<br><br>He swung his fist, expressing his indignation.<br><br>"Raphael is the Archangel of Protection and Healing."<br><br>Olga's fingertips trembled as she watched the golden light radiating from Raphael.<br><br>"They say she has the divine power to cure incurable diseases and even resurrect the dead. Among Angels, she's known for her benevolent nature. There's a legend that she saved people even while receiving divine punishment."<br><br>Her description of Raphael was the complete opposite of Wrath's. Despite her usually tough demeanor and apparent lack of faith, she seemed moved by the sight of the actual Archangel.<br><br>'Moved...?'<br><br>Raon quickly lowered his gaze to look at Rensia.<br><br>"Archangel..."<br><br>Rensia, too, seemed overwhelmed by the appearance of this mysterious being, her eyes closed and hands clasped together.<br><br>'It's not just Olga and Rensia.'<br><br>The people in Balkar Royal Palace and the neutral faction leaders who had just left the conference room also seemed to be praying, touched by Raphael's warm aura. Even though Derus had summoned Uriel, revealing that Angels weren't purely benevolent beings, facing an actual Archangel seemed to awaken their faith.<br><br>'Could the reason Raphael came here be...'<br><br>As Raon deeply furrowed his brow, Raphael clasped her hands together. Her snow-white wings, tinged with golden light, spread out, and the divine aura enveloping her spread throughout Balkar.<br><br>"How unfortunate."<br><br>Raphael shook her head as she looked down at the humans.<br><br>"Humans are still burdened with pain and anguish."<br><br>She reddened her eyes as if saddened. Seeing this, even Raon, who knew the Archangel's true nature, felt a wave of sorrow that made his heart sink.<br><br>"It's regrettable that despite the changing times and many advancements, you're still destroying yourselves, consumed by desire."<br><br>Raphael nodded calmly as she surveyed everyone in the royal capital with her ocean-blue eyes.<br><br>"But it's not your fault. The Lord of Desire is merely using you."<br><br>She lowered her eyes, her hands clasped in prayer before her chest.<br><br>"Don't worry. I'm here now."<br><br>As Raphael gently extended her hand as if dancing, a golden radiance bloomed, bestowing a massive blessing upon all of Balkar.<br><br>"I will save you. I'll erase your false desires and help you live a truthful life."<br><br>When Raphael smiled, the sky seemed to smile with her, blooming with a brilliant light.<br><br>"I am the one who blesses travelers. I'll bestow blessings upon you so that only happiness awaits until the end of your life's journey. I'll cure incurable diseases, soothe the cold and heat, and erase nights plagued by nightmares."<br><br>Raphael nodded, saying that everything would be happy if they followed her. Her melodious voice carried a power that made it seem as if she could truly fulfill these promises.<br><br>"S-She can cure incurable diseases?"<br><br>"Only good things will happen for the rest of our lives..."<br><br>"An Angel's blessing..."<br><br>"Is this really true?"<br><br>People stared at Raphael with dazed expressions, as if entranced by her.<br><br>-How is that an Angel in any way!<br><br>Wrath furrowed his brow in hatred.<br><br>-She's a ghost that bewitches people!<br><br>He shook his head, unable to understand why Angels were recorded favorably in history.<br><br>"Time is short. If you come to me now..."<br><br>Just as Raphael extended her hand as if truly intending to save humanity, a massive fireball erupted from the sky and exploded in front of her and the pillar of light enveloping her.<br><br>"What nonsense!"<br><br>It was Chamber. She bit her lip and snorted.<br><br>"Don't be fooled. It's all lies."<br><br>She stomped her foot, saying that Raphael's voice was infused with a power of enchantment.<br><br>"There's no such thing as a free lunch in this world!"<br><br>Ogram also shouted that it was all a lie, throwing a punch. His fist unleashed a fiercely rotating transcendent aura that struck the pillar of light. However, despite taking Chamber's magic and Ogram's fist attack head-on, the white pillar of light remained unbroken.<br><br>"How foolish for humans to try to reach the heavens..."<br><br>Raphael gently shook her chin, not a single fold of her clothes disturbed by Chamber and Ogram's attacks.<br><br>"How foolish."<br><br>She lowered her hand, looking regretful rather than retaliating.<br><br>"Oh!"<br><br>"To remain unscathed even against the Five Kings' attacks!"<br><br>"She really is an Archangel! It's true!"<br><br>People prayed with clasped hands, seemingly more moved by this display.<br><br>-This, too, is Raphael's authority.<br><br>Wrath clicked his tongue as he looked at the pillar of light protecting Raphael.<br><br>-As befitting the Archangel of Protection, her defense and healing are exceptional.<br><br>He lowered his eyebrows, admitting that this power was undeniable.<br><br>'Indeed...'<br><br>Raon gently bit his molars as he watched Raphael's faint smile.<br><br>'So Raphael came here to bewitch people.'<br><br>Right now, all the continent's powerhouses except for the Five Kings were gathered in Balkar Kingdom. It was clear that Raphael had appeared here to tempt the hearts of those who hadn't yet solidified their beliefs.<br><br>-Didn't I tell you?<br><br>Wrath snorted as he looked at Raphael.<br><br>-That woman is disgustingly insidious!<br><br>He gritted his teeth, saying she was the darkest of them all inside.<br><br>'It seems so.'<br><br>She'd get along well with that bastard. Raphael couldn't have come here alone. It was certain that Derus had planned this, and this insidious Archangel was carrying it out.<br><br>"What a dirty trick."<br><br>King Lecross, unable to contain himself any longer, fired a sword strike. Despite not having fully recovered from his injuries, he unleashed a heavy slash, but Raphael's pillar only shook violently without breaking.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>Larian was observing Raphael with strangely sparkling eyes, her hood removed. It was unlike her usual self.<br><br>"......"<br><br>Glenn seemed to have no intention of intervening, watching with his arms crossed to see how far Raphael would go.<br><br>"It's real."<br><br>Olga's jaw trembled as she watched Raphael remain unscathed even against the Five Kings' attacks.<br><br>"She really was an Archangel..."<br><br>Her hands shook as if the god she had been praying to had descended before her eyes.<br><br>'Hmm...'<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes deeply.<br><br>'This is quite dangerous.'<br><br>If even Olga, who didn't seem particularly devout, was this affected, the others were already staring at Raphael as if entranced.<br><br>'Wrath.'<br><br>Raon called out to Wrath, nodding his head.<br><br>'What is that authority?'<br><br>-It's a defensive art. It creates a wall of resistance strong against both physical and magical attacks by condensing divine power into light.<br><br>He shook his head, saying it would be difficult to break with human power.<br><br>'Is it that strong?'<br><br>-That's not even her full power. Of course, your old man could easily break it, whether it's full power or not.<br><br>Wrath licked his lips, saying that the other Five Kings leaders could have broken it too if they weren't injured.<br><br>-Of course, it's far beyond your power.<br><br>'Then it must be weak against your authority. Since it's divine power.'<br><br>Raon tilted his chin as he climbed onto the conference room roof.<br><br>-You understand well!<br><br>Wrath nodded vigorously, seeming to have grasped what Raon was thinking.<br><br>'Well then...'<br><br>Raon placed his hand on the hilt of the Heavenly Drive, slowly taking a deep breath.<br><br>'Even if it's an avatar, the chance to take an Archangel's head doesn't come often.'<br><br>Looking up at Raphael, he operated the Ring of Fire and Glacier at their extremes. He drew up anger from the depths of his soul, channeling it into his fiercely burning fingertips as he drew the Heavenly Drive. A blue frost bloomed on the silver blade, imbued with a mental image that had reached transcendence. Raon Zieghart Style Sword Technique.<br><br>Seventh Form: Void Slash.<br><br>-That's not enough!<br><br>Wrath sent massive authority into his mana circuit, saying the power was insufficient. The blue frost burning above the Heavenly Drive blazed even more fiercely, like flames, suppressing the brilliant light.<br><br>"Hmm?"<br><br>Raphael lowered her gaze, noticing his presence, but the Void Slash had already reached her, transformed into a beam of light. The Void Slash collided head-on with the pillar of light protecting Raphael. The pillar of light that hadn't wavered even against the Five Kings' attacks began to crack as if it would shatter at any moment.<br><br>As Raphael raised her hand, the light enveloping the pillar intensified, and the cracks began to mend.<br><br>"You are..."<br><br>She looked at Raon, who had fired the blue sword strike.<br><br>"Yes. You must be that human."<br><br>Raphael drew a thin smile, seeming to recognize him.<br><br>"It's useless, even if you've used that filthy power. Your sword won't reach me."<br><br>Raphael shook her head, sneering.<br><br>"How could a pigeon understand the will of a phoenix?"<br><br>Raon curled his lips as he twisted the Heavenly Drive connected to the Void Slash. At that moment, the blue slash blazed even more fiercely, piercing through the pillar of light. The Void Slash was a martial art that combined Ogram's Fierce Wave Arts and Alice's Spatial Sword. After neutralizing Raphael's authority with Wrath's anger, it drew out the true power of the Void Slash.<br><br>The flow of Ten Thousand Swords accumulated in the Room of Self, the power of Glacier reaching the 10th star, and Wrath’s Wrath harmonized to shoot forth a blue beast’s fang piercing through the holy light.<br><br>"Impossible!"<br><br>Raphael tried to draw divine power by raising her hand, but the slash that had pierced through space had already passed through her neck. Raphael's head fell, her eyes wide open, and the pillar of light crumbled like a sand castle.<br><br>Red blood rained down on the heads of the crowd who had been praying with closed eyes to the Archangel.</p>
