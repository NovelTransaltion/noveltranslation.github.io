        <p>Martha transformed into a yellow flash, diving straight into the embrace of the 9th Apostle.<br><br>'The opponent is stronger than me.'<br><br>She must fight with full power from the start. Drawing up all the Titan's Aura surging in her energy center, she unleashed a sword strike imbued with earth energy like lightning.<br><br>"You're ready to fight, I see."<br><br>The 9th Apostle didn't back down even as he saw Martha's sword strikes raining down as if to sink a sailing ship.<br><br>"Now I understand why your blood has such a sweet scent!"<br><br>He struck Martha's sword attack with his fist blazing with white bloody energy. The impact resounded loudly!<br><br>As Martha's sword strike wrapped in Titan's Aura clashed with the 9th Apostle's fist imbued with white bloody energy, the ship's deck swayed as if it would crumble.<br><br>Martha took five steps back to dispel the shock from colliding with the 9th Apostle, furrowing her brow.<br><br>'He really is stronger than me.'<br><br>Unlike herself who had retreated five steps, the 9th Apostle was pushed back only three steps.<br><br>Even accounting for the differences between a swordsman and a fist fighter, it meant there was more than a one-step gap in their martial prowess.<br><br>'Grandmaster High Rank or perhaps...'<br><br>No, it doesn't matter either way. Whether she was Grandmaster Middle Rank and her opponent was High Rank or even Top Rank, her only option was to kill him.<br><br>"You're much stronger than I heard."<br><br>The 9th Apostle smiled as he threw the woman he had been holding in his left arm behind him.<br><br>"I'm excited. How ecstatic will I feel when I drink your blood!"<br><br>He clenched both of his fists, igniting flames of bloody energy as if to properly begin.<br><br>"Your protruding mouth stinks. Could you shut up?"<br><br>Martha sneered, making a hand gesture telling the 9th Apostle to close his mouth.<br><br>'This guy is more of a monster than he appears.'<br><br>Though she was smiling outwardly, she didn't feel good inside. As if the impact had reached her core when she collided with the 9th Apostle, she felt a sharp pain in her heart.<br><br>'Still, I must keep fighting.'<br><br>Her goal wasn't this pig, but the White Blood Religion's leader, a top-tier Transcendent. No matter how much stronger her opponent was, she couldn't back down.<br><br>Martha rushed towards the 9th Apostle's left side, swinging her heavy sword horizontally along the horizon.<br><br>The blade flashed brightly!<br><br>This was the Crushing Ocean Sword technique directly taught by Denier. The blade imbued with the mysteries of the crushing path fell towards the 9th Apostle's neck.<br><br>"You're truly a crazy woman!"<br><br>The 9th Apostle bared his yellow teeth as if surprised by Martha's terrifying sword, thrusting out his fist. His strike also contained the will to pulverize his opponent, a powerful fist technique.<br><br>As the crushing sword and powerful fist collided repeatedly, waves of aura spread in all directions. Countless sparks exploded in the sky and sea, creating a spectacle like fireworks. However, the ship's deck, as if made of ore harder than steel, neither cracked nor broke.<br><br>"I'll turn you into well-minced meat!"<br><br>Martha's eyes flashed fiercely as she employed the killing technique of the Crushing Ocean Sword towards the 9th Apostle's heart.<br><br>"Is that something a swordsman of the Five Kings should say?"<br><br>The 9th Apostle shouted that it wasn't the right line for her, roughly extending his fist wrapped in white flames.<br><br>Martha gritted her teeth as she saw the 9th Apostle's fist technique pushing in with sheer force.<br><br>'It's disgustingly heavy.'<br><br>It feels like my own sword is attacking me.<br><br>The 9th Apostle used the same combat style as her, overwhelming the enemy with strength, speed, and weight, making it feel like fighting against a mirror.<br><br>'But why does it seem like I'm the only one taking damage?'<br><br>Even when defending, the crushing sword and powerful fist techniques should inflict great shock on the opponent's body and mind.<br><br>But unlike herself, who felt like she was about to suffer internal injuries with her insides aching, the 9th Apostle didn't seem to feel any pain at all.<br><br>'It's true he's stronger than me, but he's not a Transcendent.'<br><br>It didn't make sense that the 9th Apostle, who wasn't even a Transcendent, wouldn't receive even the slightest impact from her crushing sword.<br><br>'I need to figure out what he's doing.'<br><br>Martha spun to the right, thrusting her sword towards the 9th Apostle's undulating abdomen.<br><br>"Hmph!"<br><br>The 9th Apostle snorted, raising his fist to strike the sharply thrust sword.<br><br>Martha twisted her sword the moment the 9th Apostle extended his fist, aiming for his shoulder instead.<br><br>As this was the first attack not aimed at the front, the 9th Apostle couldn't defend properly and was pushed back after receiving a great impact on his shoulder.<br><br>"Have you decided that frontal attacks won't work anymore?"<br><br>The 9th Apostle snorted as if finding her pathetic.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Martha ignored the 9th Apostle's mockery and focused on the white energy rising from his shoulder.<br><br>'That energy is...'<br><br>She turned her gaze to the blood magic engraved across the entire deck.<br><br>"You..."<br><br>Martha frowned as she saw the 9th Apostle's shoulder healing instantly.<br><br>"You've been using blood magic in our fight."<br><br>It seemed the 9th Apostle had been using the blood magic imbued in this deck to erase the impact and wounds transmitted internally.<br><br>"You're quick-witted."<br><br>The 9th Apostle nodded, smiling thinly.<br><br>"That's right. The magic engraved on this deck can absorb blood and bloody energy. Where there's absorption, there's naturally release as well."<br><br>As he raised his hand, the deck glowed white, emitting a massive amount of bloody energy.<br><br>"I erased the impact and pain transmitted from your sword strikes with the stored bloody energy."<br><br>The 9th Apostle smiled as if impressed that she had noticed, wiggling his fingers.<br><br>"If I were to take your attacks head-on like you, I wouldn't have any bones or flesh left."<br><br>He raised an eyebrow as if asking if she still intended to keep fighting.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Martha exhaled shortly and took a step back.<br><br>'I need to get off this ship.'<br><br>The 9th Apostle himself was already stronger than her, and if he used such tricks, her chances of winning would drastically decrease.<br><br>It seemed better to fight after getting down to the port.<br><br>"There's no point in running away from here."<br><br>The 9th Apostle shook his head calmly as if reading her thoughts.<br><br>"The blood magic is bundled with this barrier."<br><br>He curled up his lips, saying that the blood magic had spread throughout this entire port wrapped in white mist.<br><br>'It's not... a lie.'<br><br>Martha bit the inside of her cheek as she looked at the smiling 9th Apostle.<br><br>'Even now, waves of bloody energy are sweeping through the port.'<br><br>Seeing the waves of bloody energy created using this sailing ship sweeping through the entire town, the 9th Apostle's words were definitely not a lie.<br><br>'Moreover...'<br><br>Fighting down there could put people in danger.<br><br>The impact of her battle with the 9th Apostle, a clash between crushing sword and powerful fist techniques, was beyond imagination. If they weren't careful, not only the Natchal Division swordsmen but also civilians could get caught up in it.<br><br>"I never thought about running away."<br><br>Martha muttered not to talk nonsense as she pointed her sword at the 9th Apostle.<br><br>"I need to tear apart not just you, but this ship as well!"<br><br>She lifted her chin, shouting for him to come at her again.<br><br>"You're putting on airs that don't suit you. Well, prey that doesn't resist isn't fun anyway."<br><br>The 9th Apostle giggled as he brought his two fists together.<br><br>"From now on, I'll crush you with my full power."<br><br>Flames of bloody energy twice as large as before ignited above his fists.<br><br>The 9th Apostle charged forward like a cannonball. He violently rotated his shoulder and brought down his right fist.<br><br>"You think your protruding belly will stop my sword?"<br><br>Martha swung up her extreme Crushing Ocean Sword technique towards the 9th Apostle charging like a wild boar.<br><br>The impact resounded loudly!<br><br>The moment the 9th Apostle's fist and her sword collided, an unbearable pain surged through her arms and legs. She deliberately stepped back to dissipate the shock building up in her body.<br><br>'His words about using full power from now on weren't a lie.'<br><br>She felt an impact twice as strong as before from the 9th Apostle's fist technique. Her insides churned as if she had already suffered internal injuries.<br><br>"We're not done yet!"<br><br>The 9th Apostle ran to her right side, unleashing a heavy fist technique as if not giving her time to rest. Despite his massive weight, his movements were as light as a feather.<br><br>Martha swallowed the blood rising in her throat and continuously unfolded the forms of the Crushing Ocean Sword to block the 9th Apostle's fist techniques.<br><br>'So I've finally suffered internal injuries.'<br><br>It was natural that even the Titan's Aura would be penetrated after blocking countless fists that could shake heaven and earth. It was rather amazing that she had only now suffered internal injuries. A deep rumbling sound echoed!<br><br>Martha gritted her teeth as she withstood the 9th Apostle's fist with her sword, which seemed like it would crush her head.<br><br>'When is Raon coming?'<br><br>He should be nearby, so it shouldn't take long... Raon was staying at a location not far from this port where she was. The signal had been sent, so it shouldn't be long before he arrived.<br><br>The 9th Apostle didn't miss the moment she was thinking about Raon and flicked his fingers to strike her abdomen.<br><br>"Kuhuk!"<br><br>Martha clutched her stomach, which felt like it was about to burst, and let out a groan mixed with the scent of blood.<br><br>"I can see your concentration slipping!"<br><br>The 9th Apostle smiled coldly and thrust his fist, burning with bloody energy, from below upwards.<br><br>Though she tried to defend somehow, the Titan's Aura imbued in her sword shattered, and she was flung backwards, hitting her back against the deck's railing. The pain was severe, as if her bones had broken.<br><br>"Ugh..."<br><br>Martha barely managed to stand up, but her hand holding the sword trembled due to the pain transmitted throughout her body.<br><br>"Where did your proud demeanor go? Why are you slumped like that?"<br><br>The 9th Apostle tilted his head as if asking if it was already over.<br><br>"Judging by your expression, you seem to be waiting for Raon Zieghart?"<br><br>He twisted his lips, saying it was obvious she was thinking of something else.<br><br>"Stop talking nonsense."<br><br>Martha chewed her lips and gritted her teeth.<br><br>"Unfortunately, this situation will end before he arrives."<br><br>The 9th Apostle shook his head, saying she wouldn't get to see Raon. It seemed he had a way to leave this place without using the sea route.<br><br>"Now die."<br><br>He shot out a fist technique burning with bloody energy even larger than before, as if to end it.<br><br>"Haah..."<br><br>Martha exhaled heavily as she saw the fist of bloody energy rushing towards her.<br><br>'Waiting for Raon to come?'<br><br>Since when did I...<br><br>'Since when did I think I was going to lose?'<br><br>She had clearly started the fight determined to kill the 9th Apostle with her own hands.<br><br>But after realizing she was outmatched in both martial prowess and preparation with magic, she began fighting more passively than before. It was natural to be pushed back when fighting with the thought that she couldn't win against her opponent.<br><br>"You stupid woman!"<br><br>Martha slapped her own cheek and brought down her sword towards the 9th Apostle's fist.<br><br>The sound of metal clashing repeatedly rang out!<br><br>Her sword, which had been consistently pushed back since the start of the battle, emitted a deep yellow light and pushed back the 9th Apostle's bloody energy.<br><br>"If I can't kill this bastard, I'll never achieve my revenge!"<br><br>Martha shouted as she pressed the 9th Apostle's fist with her sword held in both hands.<br><br>'Burn it all.'<br><br>Burn your anger and soul!<br><br>If she couldn't even defeat the 9th Apostle, who wasn't even a Transcendent, rescuing her mother from the White Blood Religion's leader would be a distant dream.<br><br>She advanced forward, swearing to die fighting here if she couldn't win.<br><br>"What..."<br><br>The 9th Apostle's eyes widened in surprise at Martha's will pushing back his fist while spitting blood.<br><br>"You're an even more dangerous woman than you appear!"<br><br>He stepped back for the first time, seeming to sense something ominous in Martha's unyielding gaze.<br><br>"I shouldn't give you any more time."<br><br>The 9th Apostle spread the bloody energy that had been concentrated in his fists throughout his entire body.<br><br>"I'll erase all traces of you and Zieghart's minions!"<br><br>He charged forward with his body wrapped in flames of bloody energy, stomping on the deck as if to destroy it. It looked like a massive cannonball was rushing towards her. A thunderous roar echoed!<br><br>Martha exhaled a thin breath as she saw the 9th Apostle approaching her in an instant.<br><br>'Raon told me to embrace my emotions.'<br><br>Raon had advised her to focus not only on swordsmanship and aura but also on emotions and willpower after she awakened from her state of enlightenment. She didn't fully understand his words at the time, but now she seemed to get it.<br><br>'I need to burn my willpower and soul.'<br><br>The oath she had made from the moment she grasped the sword. She awakened her soul burning with anger by turning her promise to destroy the White Blood Religion and save her mother into willpower. A deep rumbling sound echoed!<br><br>Martha squared her shoulders and brought down her sword imbued with conviction towards the charging 9th Apostle.<br><br>Crushing Ocean Sword technique. Crushing Heaven Unblemished. Martha's sword blade ignited with a deep and profound radiance as her willpower for revenge burned upon it. The sound of metal clashing repeatedly rang out!<br><br>The ultimate swordsmanship embodying strength, speed, weight, and the crushing path collided with the 9th Apostle's body wrapped in extreme heaviness and hardness.<br><br>Sssss!<br><br>As the 9th Apostle's bloody energy and Martha's sword clashed head-on, a terrifying shockwave swept across not just the ship but the entire port.<br><br>A thunderous explosion resounded!<br><br>***<br><br>"It's over there!"<br><br>Lawaine pointed at the port filled with white fog. It didn't look particularly strange given the storm raging in the surrounding sea.<br><br>'Now I see it clearly.'<br><br>Raon snorted as he looked at the fog-filled port.<br><br>'It's an artificial energy.'<br><br>Though the white fog appeared natural, it was emitting a very subtly distorted energy. Even he could barely sense it, so others probably just thought fog had settled.<br><br>-It reeks of filthy blood.<br><br>Wrath frowned as he scanned the fog.<br><br>-It must be the work of those bloodsuckers.<br><br>He clicked his tongue, saying it was clearly the White Blood Religion's doing. The Blade of Requiem also rang out more intensely than before, as if sensing the blood scent Wrath mentioned.<br><br>'So it is.'<br><br>Raon nodded as he gripped the vibrating Blade of Requiem.<br><br>'Well, only those blood demons would do something like this.'<br><br>There are many villains who kill people, but only the White Blood Religion would abduct and take away more than half. He had suspected it when he heard there were no corpses at all, and it seems his suspicions were correct - it was indeed the work of the blood demons.<br><br>"Everyone prepare for battle. We'll enter immediately... Hm?"<br><br>Raon furrowed his brow as he was telling Dorian and the Light Wind Palace swordsmen to get ready to fight immediately.<br><br>'That guy was here too.'<br><br>The face of a blue wolf was floating above the sea next to the port.<br><br>'It's quite different from before.'<br><br>Instead of the pure sea energy it had shown before, the Blue Wolf was now emitting a sinister energy filled with malice. It no longer felt like a spirit, but just a monster.<br><br>'Was it really a demonic beast raised by the White Blood Religion?'<br><br>Seeing the wolf's eyes glazed over, it didn't seem to be in its right mind. However, there was no time to deal with that wolf now. He needed to save the people in the port first.<br><br>"The, the ship won't go in!"<br><br>Lawaine frowned, saying the ship wouldn't move towards the port because of the barrier.<br><br>"Please wait a moment. First, we need to break the barrier..."<br><br>Just as he was about to call for the magician sailor, a massive surge of mana erupted from inside the barrier. Boom! Given the feel of the Titan's Aura, it seemed Martha was fighting desperately with a blood demon of the White Blood Religion.<br><br>"We don't have time to wait. I'll open it."<br><br>Raon stepped forward in the air, standing before the fog barrier. He imbued the Heavenly Drive with the heat of the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation and brought down an extreme Crimson Slash. A golden flash wrapped in flames connected heaven and earth, tearing apart the fog barrier that filled the space between. The barrier shattered with a loud crash!<br><br>The White Blood Religion's barrier shattered into thousands of pieces, slowly revealing the appearance of the port.<br><br>The first thing that caught his eye was, naturally, the sea in front of the port. A massive sailing ship was half-destroyed and sinking, and on the split deck lay a middle-aged man with flesh torn from shoulder to waist. <br><br>Martha was pointing her sword at the middle-aged man's neck, who was coughing up blood, even as she staggered as if about to fall.<br><br>'Martha defeated that guy?'<br><br>Even dying, the energy of the man who seemed to be an Apostle overwhelmed Martha. It was hard to understand how Martha had defeated such a monster.<br><br>"It's thanks to you."<br><br>Martha smiled painfully as she looked this way, as if reading his thoughts.<br><br>"And this is just the beginning."<br><br>Despite having overcome a grueling battle, she clenched her blood-soaked fist, burning with intense fighting spirit.<br><br>"Of my revenge!"</p>
