        <p>With a resounding blast, Raon stepped forward with his left foot and extended the Heavenly Drive. The flames blazing along the silver blade created a dark shape as if piercing a hole through the sun. This was Piercing Sun at Noon, the first form of the Devil-Cutting Blade Art, imbued with the willpower to penetrate the sun itself.<br><br>With a piercing ring, Raon violently brought down the blade that had risen into the air. The intensely flashing flames fell like lightning, creating a massive crater in the North Sea, resembling a volcanic crater. This was the Flame Division Strike of the Devil-Cutting Blade Art.<br><br>With a whoosh, even after the Flame Division Strike, Raon continued to perfectly control both sword and flame as if they were extensions of his hands, unleashing the forms of the Devil-Cutting Blade Art one after another. The overwhelming power of the Devil-Cutting Blade Art was so great that the glacier protected by the Gold Dragon Paratheus began to slowly melt.<br><br>"How does it look?"<br><br>The Warlord asked the Blade Queen while keeping his eyes fixed on Raon's sword.<br><br>"What we wanted was intermediate level, right?"<br><br>The Blade Queen pressed her trembling lips with her front teeth.<br><br>"It seems he's far exceeded that level?"<br><br>She let out a hollow laugh, wondering what had happened in the few days they had left Raon alone.<br><br>"It's true that his form combinations still need work. However..."<br><br>The Blade Queen lowered her eyebrows with slight uncertainty.<br><br>"The sword forms themselves are quite solid. It means he understands what's truly important in the Devil-Cutting Blade Art."<br><br>She nodded, acknowledging that Raon had precisely grasped the essential points of each individual form of the Devil-Cutting Blade Art.<br><br>"My thoughts exactly."<br><br>Just as the Warlord smiled faintly in satisfaction, Raon finished demonstrating the Devil-Cutting Blade Art and drew the Wooden Ring Sword. The leaf-shaped guard frosted over white as blue frost spread in all directions. With a sharp ring, Raon brought down the Wooden Ring Sword as gently as if combing a woman's hair.<br><br>Not like a typical sword art, but a flow as elegant as swordsmanship. Yet its power was fierce and threatening enough to split and shatter glaciers. This was Frost-Clad Blood Strike, the first form of the Devil-Fighting Sword Art, possessing a savagery opposite to the flow of martial arts.<br><br>With a thunderous sound, Raon slashed the tilted Wooden Ring Sword upward at an angle. Unlike the original flow of the Devil-Fighting Sword Art, it rose with a slightly twisted angle. The second form, Demon Battle Swing Strike, which he had developed with the Warlord to enhance its power and weight, revealed itself to the world for the first time. With a piercing ring!<br><br>Raon stepped with heavy footwork, connecting the forms of the Devil-Fighting Sword Art as if drawing a single line.<br><br>Unlike the Devil-Cutting Blade Art, each individual form lacked refinement, but the combinations flowed from beginning to end without the slightest tremor.<br><br>"How does it look to you?"<br><br>The Blade Queen nudged the Warlord's back with her shoulder.<br><br>"..."<br><br>The Warlord couldn't answer immediately, his fingertips trembling where they rested on his thigh.<br><br>"Though the forms aren't perfected, their combinations flow as smoothly as a single technique. He's not just understanding the true meaning of the Devil-Fighting Sword Art, he's actualizing it."<br><br>He let out a long breath, indicating that even "impressive" would be an understatement.<br><br>"And he's properly implemented all the modifications we discussed."<br><br>The Warlord nodded, seemingly moved by this fact.<br><br>"Someone like him might be able to walk the path I couldn't reach."<br><br>He smiled softly, suggesting that Raon might be able to reach the ultimate level of the Devil-Fighting Sword Art.<br><br>[Well, he's not bad...]<br><br>The Gold Dragon, Paratheus, tilted his head slightly. However, his eyes shook intensely, contrary to his words. Having watched the Sword Queen and Warlord’s martial arts for so long, he could feel just how extraordinary Raon’s actions were. <br><br>Sssss...<br><br>After fully displaying the Devil-Fighting Sword Art’s techniques, Raon rested the Wooden Ring Sword, still emanating frost, on his shoulder.<br><br>"Well done! You've exceeded our expectations!"<br><br>"I acknowledge you, Lord Raon."<br><br>Just as the Blade Queen and Warlord rose simultaneously to applaud Raon, he lifted both the Heavenly Drive and the Wooden Ring Sword. Crimson flames blazed along the Heavenly Drive while blue frost covered the blade of the Wooden Ring Sword. With a piercing ring!<br><br>The Heavenly Drive traced the first form of the Devil-Cutting Blade Art, Piercing Sun at Noon, creating a fiery rift in the air.<br><br>Simultaneously, the Wooden Ring Sword fell, shaking the massive glacier. It was Frost-Clad Blood Strike, the first form of the Devil-Fighting Sword Art. With a resonating boom, Raon turned his ankle to the right as he slashed down with the Heavenly Drive and raised the Wooden Ring Sword. The flame-summoned lightning split the glacier while blue frost cleaved the sky in half. <br><br>Around Raon, petals of flame and mists of frost swirled like a meteor shower. These forces should have naturally clashed destructively, but the Diamond Earth Aura intervened between the flames and frost, acting as a breakwater that allowed him to unleash the ultimate forms of both the Devil-Cutting Blade Art and the Devil-Fighting Sword Art.<br><br>The forms of the Devil-Fighting Sword Art and Devil-Cutting Blade Art flowed together as if they had always been a single martial art, their trajectories of sword and blade covering heaven and earth without the slightest interference.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>"Is this... the true martial art of the Sword and Saber Sovereign..."<br><br>The Blade Queen and Warlord revealed eyes wet with emotion as they watched their lifelong rival's martial art harmonize with their own to create even greater power. The two forgot even to breathe, completely absorbed in the beauty and strength of Raon's swordsmanship.<br><br>After finally completing the combination of the Devil-Cutting Blade Art and Devil-Fighting Sword Art, Raon lowered both the Heavenly Drive and the Wooden Ring Sword.<br><br>'Fortunately, it worked.'<br><br>The combination of the Devil-Cutting Blade Art and Devil-Fighting Sword Art had been more natural than expected. As the memories of the past month flowed through his mind, a deep smile unconsciously appeared on his face.<br><br>-You, you...<br><br>Wrath descended before his eyes, his jaw trembling.<br><br>-Did you plan to use both swordsmanship and blade techniques together from the start?<br><br>He widened his eyes as if he hadn't known at all.<br><br>'Of course.'<br><br>He nodded calmly, having planned the combination of the Devil-Cutting Blade Art and Devil-Fighting Sword Art from the beginning.<br><br>'It seems to have worked out a bit better than expected.'<br><br>Though it wasn't perfect, he allowed himself a slight smile, satisfied with the results achieved in such a short time.<br><br>-But you never even practiced it once!<br><br>Wrath gaped, saying it made no sense.<br><br>'As I've said before, I'm a practical fighter.'<br><br>Though this was his first time simultaneously using the Devil-Cutting Blade Art and Devil-Fighting Sword Art, it wasn't particularly difficult since he had received dual-sword techniques from Sheryl and had always wielded two swords due to the Divine-Demonic Harmony.<br><br>-Damn it all...<br><br>As Wrath ground his teeth, the footsteps of the Blade Queen and Warlord approached. With a sliding sound, they stood before him, drawing their respective weapons. With a resonating thud, they both drove their weapons into the ground and knelt on their right knees.<br><br>'Again? No, this is different...'<br><br>Though he had seen this sight often, something was different this time. The Blade Queen and Warlord's burning gazes were directed not at a young successor of the Sword and Saber Sovereign, but at the swordsman named Raon Zieghart.<br><br>"I, Siera, heir to the Blade Gate..."<br><br>"I, Yuber, heir to the Sword Gate..."<br><br>The Blade Queen and Warlord spoke simultaneously as they bowed their heads.<br><br>"We pledge ourselves to our Lord!"<br><br>***<br><br>"I'll be in your care as well."<br><br>Raon bowed politely to the Blade Queen and Warlord.<br><br>"Please rise now. For your reputation, you both kneel far too easily."<br><br>After saying he would accept it just for today, he helped the Blade Queen and Warlord to their feet.<br><br>"I'll say it now, but I never expected to serve such a young lord."<br><br>The Blade Queen let out a hollow laugh, saying she was still bewildered.<br><br>"Actually, I had planned to pass on the Devil-Cutting Blade Art to that person."<br><br>She smiled faintly, saying she had considered making the Warlord the successor of the Sword and Saber Sovereign.<br><br>"I knew."<br><br>The Warlord nodded calmly, as if he had noticed from the beginning.<br><br>"That's why I only used an appropriate level of martial prowess for the situation."<br><br>He lowered his hand, saying he had the same thoughts as the Blade Queen.<br><br>"Anyway!"<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>The Blade Queen and Warlord smiled gently at each other, seeming to have grown closer over the past month.<br><br>[Ugh, how cheesy!]<br><br>-Can't stand watching this...<br><br>The Gold Dragon Paratheus and Wrath simultaneously wrinkled their noses in disgust.<br><br>"Let's leave this place now. The glacier seems about to collapse."<br><br>Raon raised his hand to the Blade Queen and Warlord while lightly tapping the melting glacier.<br><br>"We must follow our lord's words."<br><br>The Blade Queen nodded in understanding.<br><br>"I've already packed my belongings, so we can leave right away."<br><br>The Warlord said he had finished preparing in advance, as if he had long planned to make Raon his lord.<br><br>"Then let's go now."<br><br>Raon smiled faintly and gestured behind him.<br><br>"Evelyn! If you would."<br><br>"Yes!"<br><br>As if she had been waiting, Evelyn let out a clear cry and opened a dimensional gate. With a resonating hum! Beyond the shimmering blue dimensional gate, the peak of Mount Sterlin where Sloth's bed lay became visible.<br><br>"This dimensional gate connects to the peak of Mount Sterlin. Shall we enter?"<br><br>Raon raised his hand, pointing to the dimensional gate.<br><br>"We should indeed see the place we've damaged."<br><br>The Blade Queen nodded and stood before the dimensional gate.<br><br>"She's quite a skilled magician."<br><br>The Warlord let out a small gasp of admiration at Evelyn's mana manipulation.<br><br>[It's a bit narrow for me to enter, isn't it?]<br><br>The Gold Dragon Paratheus tilted his head while looking at the dimensional gate.<br><br>"Why would you need to go through there!"<br><br>The Blade Queen frowned as if telling him not to talk nonsense.<br><br>"You clean up here and fly over!"<br><br>She stamped her foot, telling him to finish dealing with everything here before coming.<br><br>"Hmm, that's right."<br><br>The Warlord nodded calmly.<br><br>[No, why should I clean up the mess you all made...]<br><br>"Let's go in!"<br><br>The Blade Queen ignored Paratheus's words and entered the dimensional gate first.<br><br>"Clean up thoroughly before coming."<br><br>The Warlord also shot Paratheus a sharp look before following the Blade Queen.<br><br>[Why won't that devilish couple just die already!]<br><br>Paratheus trembled his fists in frustration.<br><br>[They've far exceeded the average human lifespan!]<br><br>Even while cursing the Blade Queen and Warlord, he dutifully began melting the glacier and clearing away the cabin and other traces.<br><br>-To think there's such a pushover lizard!<br><br>Wrath ground his teeth, saying he'd never seen such a fool.<br><br>'...Indeed.'<br><br>It reminded him of someone. Raon awkwardly nodded and entered the dimensional gate.<br><br>'I'm really curious.'<br><br>He wondered what story lay behind an ancient dragon becoming both friend and servant.<br><br>"Wow, we really destroyed a lot! Nothing's left."<br><br>"We certainly made a mistake."<br><br>The Blade Queen and Warlord sighed deeply as they surveyed the devastated landscape of Mount Sterlin. With a rumbling sound, as soon as Raon emerged from the dimensional gate, something like a grub sprang up from the ground.<br><br>"P-Palace Master!"<br><br>It was Dorian. He crawled over and grabbed Raon's pants.<br><br>"Why did you take so long to come back!"<br><br>He had sunken cheeks and tearful eyes.<br><br>"Why have you gotten so thin?"<br><br>Raon blinked as he helped Dorian up. His once chubby cheeks had hollowed out, suggesting he hadn't eaten properly for a while.<br><br>"You brought plenty of food though."<br><br>"I-I was scared..."<br><br>Dorian pointed at Sloth, who was sleeping with the blanket pulled over his head. He seemed to have been trembling in fear for the past month.<br><br>"I told you it was fine..."<br><br>Raon let out a wry laugh.<br><br>"He doesn't harm people."<br><br>"How can it be fine when he's a demon king!"<br><br>Dorian sniffled, saying he still couldn't get used to it. Though he looked pitiful, his appearance was honestly much better now.<br><br>"Where's Evelyn?"<br><br>Raon turned his head, calling for Evelyn.<br><br>"I'm right here!"<br><br>Evelyn jumped down from midair with a bright smile. She brushed back her perfectly neat hair and waggled her finger.<br><br>"Sorry for making you wait a month."<br><br>Raon bowed his head to Evelyn. Seeing Dorian's state, he apologized first, thinking Evelyn must not be happy either.<br><br>"I'm fine."<br><br>Evelyn shook her head as if to say such words weren't necessary.<br><br>"Because I was always with you."<br><br>She said this with an eerie smile.<br><br>-Hieeeek!<br><br>Wrath retreated in horror.<br><br>"Al-always?"<br><br>Raon's jaw trembled as he looked at the smiling Evelyn.<br><br>"Of course! I've been watching you from nearby the whole time."<br><br>Evelyn shrugged her shoulders as if to say not to worry.<br><br>"Your sword training and aura cultivation were all amazing. I could have watched for a year."<br><br>She laughed, saying she hadn't noticed time passing while watching him.<br><br>"I... I see..."<br><br>Raon subtly turned his eyes toward Wrath.<br><br>'Did you sense her at all?'<br><br>-N-not at all!<br><br>Wrath shook his head vigorously.<br><br>-It seems her stalking abilities have reached demonic god levels!<br><br>He clutched his head, saying he could no longer sense Evelyn's presence at all.<br><br>"Huhu."<br><br>Evelyn wore a deep smile as if the past month had been purely enjoyable.<br><br>"Ahaha..."<br><br>Raon laughed awkwardly as he slowly backed away.<br><br>"S-Sloth?"<br><br>To change the subject, he pulled back Sloth's blanket and woke him.<br><br>"Time to wake up."<br><br>"Mmm..."<br><br>Sloth slowly lifted his eyelids, seeming to have had a satisfying sleep. Unlike Dorian, his face had a healthy glow.<br><br>"I've resolved the noise issue. There won't be anything to disturb your sleep now. The situation is..."<br><br>"Then... that's fine..."<br><br>Sloth nodded without even listening to the explanation.<br><br>"You don't need to hear it?"<br><br>"If it's... resolved... that's all... that matters..."<br><br>He yawned long as if showing his trust.<br><br>"I see."<br><br>Raon let out a wry laugh. He couldn't understand why demon kings like Wrath and Sloth were so naive.<br><br>"I have a favor to ask of you too, will you hear me out?"<br><br>"What... is it...?"<br><br>Sloth blinked, telling him to speak. He seemed eager to hear it quickly so he could go back to sleep.<br><br>"Soon there will be a war with the Archangels. I'd like to borrow your power then."<br><br>Raon bit his lip slightly as he looked at Sloth.<br><br>"Archangels... I thought so..."<br><br>Sloth nodded, saying he had dreamed of sensing the Archangels' energy from far away.<br><br>"About that situation..."<br><br>"I'll help... However..."<br><br>Without even hearing the explanation, he agreed to help while looking at Raon.<br><br>"Fighting... Archangels... is dangerous... dimensional balance... authority... ah, too troublesome..."<br><br>Sloth slowly shook his head as if explaining had become too bothersome.<br><br>"There are... things... I... need... for... me to... fight... ...."<br><br>"Things you need?"<br><br>"Usually... impossible... but you... can do it..."<br><br>He looked at Raon's wrist as he spoke with heavy lips.<br><br>"That is..."</p>
