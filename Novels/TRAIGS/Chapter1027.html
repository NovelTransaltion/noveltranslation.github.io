        <p>"Annihilated?"<br><br>Raon frowned, placing his hand on the table.<br><br>"Even if a village was destroyed, they wouldn't use the word 'annihilated'..."<br><br>He questioned the use of such a strong term for a small village, rather than a kingdom or clan.<br><br>"I wish I didn't have to phrase it that way, but I must because it truly was annihilated."<br><br>Lawaine bit his lip hard enough to leave teeth marks.<br><br>"In a village of over two hundred people, there are no survivors, and all houses and buildings have been completely obliterated."<br><br>He sighed heavily, saying the scene could only be described as annihilation.<br><br>"Were both villages destroyed in the same manner?"<br><br>Raon furrowed his brow, drumming his fingers on the table.<br><br>"Yes. Both looked as if they had been decaying for decades."<br><br>"Are the two villages adjacent?"<br><br>"No, they're quite far apart."<br><br>Lawaine shook his head, explaining that several ports and cities lay between the two annihilated villages.<br><br>"Then the ports in between..."<br><br>"Are perfectly fine. They say nothing happened at all."<br><br>He frowned, adding that not even a large wave had occurred.<br><br>"If that's the case..."<br><br>Raon let out a short sigh as he looked at Lawaine's grim expression.<br><br>"It means this wasn't a natural phenomenon."<br><br>Given that the ports between the two villages were unaffected, it was definitely not a natural occurrence.<br><br>"Correct. I thought the same, so while investigating..."<br><br>Lawaine's fingertips trembled as he looked at Raon.<br><br>"I encountered a monster of the sea."<br><br>"A monster?"<br><br>Raon swallowed dryly, leaning his upper body towards Lawaine.<br><br>"To explain from the beginning, I heard rumors that the same phenomenon had occurred in a village outside our territory, so I immediately went to investigate."<br><br>Lawaine lowered his voice, grasping his trembling right hand with his left.<br><br>"There too, no bodies were visible, but the entire village was soaked in seawater. As if a massive tidal wave had engulfed it."<br><br>He frowned, saying he witnessed seawater rising and receding throughout the entire village.<br><br>"Then it was natural..."<br><br>"Actually, I had been thinking it was an artificial phenomenon, so I found it strange and was searching the surrounding coast when..."<br><br>"Don't tell me."<br><br>Raon swallowed dryly again, watching Lawaine's trembling eyes.<br><br>"You encountered it directly?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Lawaine clutched his head as if recalling the moment he met the monster.<br><br>"While following an unusual water current I'd never seen before on the Azure Wind, that massive monster suddenly emerged from the endless sea before me."<br><br>His voice trembled, as if he had felt an overwhelming difference in power.<br><br>"What kind of monster was it?"<br><br>"A, a wolf."<br><br>Lawaine mentioned a beast completely unrelated to the sea.<br><br>"A wolf?"<br><br>"Not an ordinary wolf. It was a being that contained both the physical form and soul of the sea. So enormous that it felt like the ocean itself was looking down on me."<br><br>He let out a deep groan, saying it possessed a soul so vast it made him feel insignificant.<br><br>"It disappeared as soon as it saw me, seemingly uninterested, but if we had fought there..."<br><br>Lawaine grimaced as if the outcome was obvious.<br><br>"We would have been annihilated. The aura that wolf possessed was on par with a Transcendent."<br><br>He shuddered as if still exposed to the wolf's aura.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes, looking at the seemingly frightened Lawaine.<br><br>'A wolf that could frighten Lawaine to this extent...'<br><br>Lawaine was an experienced Grandmaster. For someone like him to be this afraid, it was definitely no ordinary monster.<br><br>'Still, it can't be Transcendent-level.'<br><br>Aside from Ancient Dragons, Transcendent-level monsters hardly existed. At the time, Lawaine likely lacked proper judgment due to tension and worry, so there was a high possibility he had misjudged.<br><br>"So you returned to ask for Alice's help because of this?"<br><br>Raon nodded, finally understanding why Lawaine's expression had been so dark.<br><br>"That's right. It would be too much for me, but Alice could certainly hunt that wolf. Moreover, other pirate groups are increasing in the area..."<br><br>Lawaine sighed, saying he returned to the family immediately because he thought it was a matter that needed to be dealt with as soon as possible.<br><br>"However, since we don't know when Alice's training will end..."<br><br>He lowered his eyebrows, as if worried about other villages and ports even at this moment.<br><br>"Then that task..."<br><br>Raon placed his hands on the table as he set down his teacup.<br><br>"Let our Light Wind Palace handle it."<br><br>"Pardon?"<br><br>Lawaine raised his eyes as if asking what Raon meant.<br><br>"No, no. This isn't Zieghart's business, but our Pirate King's..."<br><br>"Technically, the Pirate King isn't Zieghart's ally, but more like a subordinate organization of our family, just like the Light Wind Palace."<br><br>Now that Alice had returned to Zieghart, it wasn't strange to consider her Pirate King forces as Zieghart's military power.<br><br>"It's only natural that we should protect those villages, and our swordsmen need practical experience after a month of training."<br><br>Raon shook his head, telling Lawaine not to worry.<br><br>"But, but that seems like too much of an imposition..."<br><br>"It's a good opportunity to repay what we received from Aunt. Please don't refuse."<br><br>He bowed his head, saying he was asking for a favor rather than helping.<br><br>"Well..."<br><br>Lawaine let out a surprised breath, bewildered that he was being asked for a favor instead of asking for one himself.<br><br>'He's changed again.'<br><br>The previous Raon had been righteous but somewhat forceful. Now, he seemed to be maturing not just as a warrior, but as a person.<br><br>"I understand. Then I'll be in your care."<br><br>Lawaine bowed deeply, as if addressing Alice, saying he was grateful for the help.<br><br>***<br><br>After telling Lawaine to prepare for departure, Raon immediately went to the audience chamber to inform Glenn about Lawaine's story.<br><br>"So..."<br><br>Glenn narrowed his eyes, caressing the neatly repaired armrest of the throne.<br><br>"You're saying you want to go to sea this time?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Raon nodded calmly.<br><br>"By now, everyone knows Alice Zieghart is the Pirate King. In other words, it's not an exaggeration to say that villages protected under the Pirate King's name are under Zieghart's name."<br><br>He pointed to a map, saying that while it might not be the reality, that's how others would perceive it.<br><br>"Two such villages have already fallen, so our subordinate forces might be scared and fearful. Normally, Alice would have rushed out, but since she's focused on training, we want to handle it instead."<br><br>Raon bowed his head, saying he wanted to deal with this matter along with the Light Wind Palace.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Glenn turned his gaze to the window, stroking his chin.<br><br>"Is there something bothering you?"<br><br>"Since Lawaine saw it directly, that sea wolf must indeed be the culprit. However..."<br><br>He let out a low groan as he looked back at Raon.<br><br>"I'm a bit worried about the wolf possessing an aura comparable to a Transcendent."<br><br>Glenn frowned, saying it could be dangerous if it truly was at that level.<br><br>-Well, the sea is vast, so all sorts of creatures exist.<br><br>Wrath nodded as if agreeing with Glenn's thoughts.<br><br>-If you go into the deep sea, you might encounter monsters even you would struggle against.<br><br>He raised his round hand as if to intimidate.<br><br>"I think Lawaine misjudged, but if it really is Transcendent-level, I'd welcome it even more."<br><br>Raon smiled, saying that's what he hoped for.<br><br>"That monster's fight would lead me to greater heights."<br><br>Training in the practice grounds wasn't of much help to him now. Going out and fighting against strong opponents would be more beneficial.<br><br>"Well, there are few who could defeat you now."<br><br>Glenn nodded as if he had no choice.<br><br>"Alright. I permit it."<br><br>He waved his hand, telling Raon to be careful.<br><br>"Understood."<br><br>As Raon was about to leave the audience chamber after expressing his gratitude, Glenn spoke up.<br><br>"Ahem! Wait a moment."<br><br>Glenn raised his hand with an exaggerated cough.<br><br>"Se-send me letters too. Not just to him."<br><br>He rolled his eyes slightly, asking Raon not to send letters only to Rector, but to him as well.<br><br>-Wow...<br><br>Wrath let out a disbelieving laugh.<br><br>-Jealous of a single letter even though he sees his grandson every day, this old geezer is really...<br><br>He shook his head, wondering how he had endured this clingy person until now.<br><br>"Understood."<br><br>Raon nodded with a smile. After promising to send letters regularly to Glenn during the voyage, he left the audience chamber and returned to the fifth training ground where the swordsmen were likely still training.<br><br>"You shouldn't leave during training hours!"<br><br>Martha frowned, asking where he had disappeared to while he was teaching her.<br><br>"But Raon is allowed to..."<br><br>Runaan shook her head, saying Raon was the owner of this place.<br><br>"Sigh, lecturing the lord..."<br><br>Burren rubbed his temples, saying he didn't know where to start teaching.<br><br>"Enough joking around, everyone gather."<br><br>Raon called for the swordsmen scattered throughout the training ground and climbed onto the platform.<br><br>"You know better than anyone that your martial prowess and mental strength have grown significantly through a month of training."<br><br>He continued speaking while observing the swordsmen emitting auras like seasoned warriors.<br><br>"It seems it's time to test what you've built up here."<br><br>Raon nodded, saying it was time for practical experience.<br><br>"Finally got a mission!"<br><br>Martha bumped her fists together as if approving.<br><br>"What kind of mission is it this time?"<br><br>Burren's eyes gleamed intelligently, as if he needed to plan first.<br><br>"I'm fine staying here..."<br><br>Runaan yawned slightly, as if reluctant to leave.<br><br>"This mission is..."<br><br>Raon relayed the story he had heard from Lawaine to the Light Wind Palace swordsmen.<br><br>"Tr-Transcendent-level monster?"<br><br>"Did such a thing exist?"<br><br>"He, he must have seen wrong. It was far away, right?"<br><br>"Can you even call that a monster if it's real?"<br><br>"Whether it's real or fake, it's no ordinary beast if it can destroy entire villages..."<br><br>The swordsmen's eyes trembled with tension at the mention of a Transcendent-level monster. However, they weren't simply afraid; they seemed to be licking their lips, eager to test their skills in this mission.<br><br>-It seems the children are finally breaking out of their shells.<br><br>Wrath nodded approvingly at the Light Wind Palace swordsmen's reactions.<br><br>'Indeed. They've changed a lot.'<br><br>The desire to confirm their abilities despite knowing the danger was the very essence of Zieghart's swordsmen.<br><br>'Though some aren't like that...'<br><br>Raon let out a short sigh as he turned his gaze to the right.<br><br>"Tr-Transcendent is a bit much, right? If we fall into the sea, we'll die before we can even use our swords..."<br><br>"That's right. I'm not really interested..."<br><br>Krein and Dorian muttered to themselves, seemingly uninterested.<br><br>"Stop talking nonsense and get ready."<br><br>Martha smiled coldly, putting her arms around Krein and Dorian's shoulders as if threatening to kill them here if they tried to back out.<br><br>"N-No, that's not what we meant!"<br><br>"Of course we're going!"<br><br>Dorian and Krein forced smiles, saying they had no intention of backing out.<br><br>"Then gather here at dawn tomorrow after finishing your preparations."<br><br>Raon tilted his chin, looking down at the Light Wind Palace swordsmen.<br><br>"Dawn tomorrow?"<br><br>"That's only a few hours away!"<br><br>The swordsmen widened their eyes, saying it was too soon.<br><br>"We don't know when another village or port might be attacked, so we need to leave as soon as possible."<br><br>Raon shook his head, saying he had initially wanted to leave right away.<br><br>"That's right!"<br><br>Martha nodded, saying he had thought well.<br><br>"Only ten hours of sleep..."<br><br>Runaan turned away first, saying she needed to go back quickly.<br><br>"Understood!"<br><br>Burren said he would prepare well and began explaining precautions to the Light Wind Palace swordsmen.<br><br>"I'll check the supplies!"<br><br>Now that they were set to depart, Dorian ran to the warehouse, thinking of his duties.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Raon gently curled the corners of his mouth as he watched the bustling training ground.<br><br>'This should be perfect for the Light Wind Palace's practical experience, given that strong pirates have also increased.'<br><br>Of course, the wolf was the most important matter.<br><br>'I wonder how strong this sea-dwelling puppy is.'<br><br>***<br><br>The next day, Raon and the Light Wind Palace, guided by Lawaine, were able to reach the coast where the Azure Wind was docked by taking a series of Dimensional Gates.<br><br>"This ship is still massive."<br><br>Martha whistled as she looked up at the enormous exterior of the Azure Wind.<br><br>"It seems even bigger..."<br><br>Runaan blinked, saying the Azure Wind seemed to have grown.<br><br>"That's right. We added black wood, making it wider than before."<br><br>Lawaine nodded, explaining that they had reinforced the hull with sturdy black wood due to battles with pirates. Though he was smiling, his eyes trembled slightly, likely due to worry about the villages and ports.<br><br>"Is everything prepared?"<br><br>Raon looked at Lawaine while touching the hull made of black wood.<br><br>"Yes. Not knowing when Alice would return, we prepared food and supplies in advance."<br><br>Lawaine nodded, saying they could last over two months even if they left right away.<br><br>"Then let's depart immediately."<br><br>Raon nodded, seeing Lawaine's tense expression.<br><br>"We don't know when another village might be attacked. It's best to move quickly."<br><br>"Ah, was I that obvious..."<br><br>Lawaine scratched his head, seemingly embarrassed.<br><br>"I'm sorry. And thank you."<br><br>He climbed the stairs onto the ship first, expressing gratitude for the consideration.<br><br>"Let's go."<br><br>Raon gestured for the Light Wind Palace swordsmen to board immediately and climbed onto the Azure Wind.<br><br>'This hasn't changed.'<br><br>Unlike the reinforced exterior, the ship's interior hadn't changed much. He smiled involuntarily, reminded of when he first met Alice here.<br><br>"Prepare for departure!"<br><br>While Raon was lost in memories, Lawaine had called the crew to prepare for departure.<br><br>"Light Wind Palace Master."<br><br>He approached Raon after completing all departure preparations in 30 minutes.<br><br>"Please give your orders."<br><br>Lawaine bowed deeply, saying he was the temporary captain.<br><br>"Set sail."<br><br>Raon nodded to Lawaine and the crew who were looking only at him.<br><br>"Set sail!"<br><br>"Setting sail!"<br><br>As Lawaine and the crew echoed his command, the sails in the center of the deck unfurled, long enough to block the sea, and the massive sailing ship slowly began to move. The Azure Wind cut through the blue sea, following the wind as if weightless.<br><br>"It will take half a day to reach the port we protect, so please rest in the cabin."<br><br>Lawaine bowed, saying it would be noisy for a while, so they should rest in the cabin.<br><br>"No, I'd like to see the sea for a while. It's been a long time."<br><br>Raon said he would stay on deck and turned around.<br><br>"Those who want to rest can rest, and those who want to train can train."<br><br>He waved his hand, telling the Light Wind Palace swordsmen to do as they pleased.<br><br>"Okay, I'll sleep..."<br><br>As soon as she heard those words, Runaan said she would sleep first and entered the cabin.<br><br>"I'll meditate for a bit."<br><br>Burren closed his eyes in a corner of the deck, saying he felt his martial arts sense was lacking.<br><br>"I'll check the supplies! They might be insufficient!"<br><br>Dorian went down to the storage area, saying he would check the supplies as if the Azure Wind was his own ship. He truly had an admirable work ethic.<br><br>"I, I'll rest a bit..."<br><br>Krein blinked his eyes as if tired and headed towards the cabin.<br><br>"No."<br><br>Raon raised his hand to block Krein's path.<br><br>"You're the most lacking. Do aura training next to me."<br><br>"Ugh..."<br><br>Krein rolled his eyes as if thinking of escape, but then sighed and sat down, realizing there was no way out. As Raon began the torturous training method of pushing heat and cold into Krein's back, Martha approached.<br><br>"Me too, please."<br><br>Martha nodded, asking for the same torturous training method.<br><br>"You..."<br><br>"I want to get even a little stronger until that day comes."<br><br>She bit her lip, saying she wanted to improve her skills as much as possible before fighting the Leader of the White Blood Religion.<br><br>'Her resolve has become even firmer.'<br><br>Since breaking through the mid-level Grandmaster wall, Martha had been craving power even more. Knowing her circumstances, he couldn't easily refuse.<br><br>"Haa."<br><br>Raon let out a short sigh and placed his hand on Martha's back.<br><br>"It's going to hurt a lot."<br><br>He pushed in the heat of the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation and the cold of Glacier with increased intensity, proportional to her growth.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Despite feeling pain as if her entire body was being torn apart, Martha didn't let out a single groan and began her aura training while sitting there.<br><br>-She's tough.<br><br>Wrath looked at Martha with bitter eyes, contrary to his words about her being tough.<br><br>'She is tough. But I would have done the same.'<br><br>If he had been in Martha's situation, he would have pushed himself even more severely.<br><br>'I can't stay like this either.'<br><br>Raon briefly licked his lips and leaned against the deck.<br><br>'To help her, I need to become stronger.'<br><br>Martha alone could never rescue her mother from the Leader of the White Blood Religion. It would take himself and another top-tier Transcendent to barely face the Leader of the White Blood Religion.<br><br>'Whether to kill the Leader of the White Blood Religion or save the body...'<br><br>The important thing was achieving the Soul Sword. Without advancing the Soul Sword, they could never rescue Martha's mother.<br><br>'Focus...'<br><br>As Raon was about to open his soul's realm to enter the domain of the Soul Sword while feeling the sea breeze, a chilling aura washed over him, as if someone was looking down on him from the far end of the sea. It wasn't a human gaze. It was an eerie sensation, as if nature itself was observing him.<br><br>"This is..."<br><br>Raon hurriedly turned his body to look at the coastline where the sun was shining. At the unfathomable end of the sea, the face of a massive wolf, with waves for its mane, appeared.</p>
