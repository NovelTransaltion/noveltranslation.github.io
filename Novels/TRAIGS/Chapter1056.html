        <p>The gates of hell, adorned with images of demons trapped in black coffins, creaked open, and the world was dyed in a crimson hue.<br><br>The 10th Apostle opened his eyes in a bizarre space where blood-red liquid reached up to his knees.<br><br>"This is..."<br><br>He swallowed hard as he watched white droplets of blood from his shoulder wound turn red.<br><br>"My sword domain."<br><br>Martha's clear voice rang out from behind the 10th Apostle.<br><br>"Sword domain?"<br><br>The 10th Apostle furrowed his brow as he turned around.<br><br>"This sword domain is called the Devil Prison."<br><br>Martha smiled gently, a stark contrast to the bloody hell around her.<br><br>"It's a prison for demons like you and the Leader of the White Blood Religion who shouldn't exist in this world."<br><br>"How... You don't have Zieghart's blood, so how..."<br><br>The 10th Apostle deeply furrowed his brow, unable to comprehend.<br><br>"I made a soul oath with my spirit and mental image. I prayed that if I could kill you and that damned woman with this sword domain, I'd never wield a sword again."<br><br>Martha curled her red lips as she explained that this sword domain was created solely with revenge in mind.<br><br>"Of course, it would have been impossible without that foolish master's help. I needed to train in elemental power."<br><br>Even if she had become a Grandmaster and made a soul oath, it would have been impossible to create a sword domain immediately. Thanks to Rimmer's training in using elemental power to create a sword domain, she was able to complete the current Devil Prison.<br><br>"Even so, it's impossible..."<br><br>"The Devil Prison is a sword domain created solely for you and the Leader of the White Blood Religion. I can't use it on anyone else, even if they're blood demons."<br><br>The deepest grudge she held was against the 10th Apostle who took her mother away and the Leader of the White Blood Religion who possessed her mother's body.<br><br>This sword domain was nothing less than the embodiment of the resentment she had harbored against these two since childhood.<br><br>"I didn't expect you to create a sword domain. However..."<br><br>The 10th Apostle took a deep breath with a cold gaze, as if looking for a way to escape despite being trapped in the sword domain.<br><br>"An incomplete sword domain like this is meaningless."<br><br>He pointed his spear at her, seemingly thinking this sword domain was unfinished.<br><br>"If I kill you, this sword domain will collapse too."<br><br>The 10th Apostle stomped his foot roughly, as if he was about to give it his all, and shot out a spear technique with bloody energy rotating in a spiral.<br><br>However, the powerful bloody energy on his spear turned to red dust and disappeared before reaching Martha.<br><br>"W-What is this..."<br><br>The 10th Apostle's eyes widened, seeming more surprised than when he first entered the sword domain.<br><br>"You're impatient."<br><br>Martha waved her hand at the 10th Apostle, whose lips were trembling.<br><br>"The Devil Prison is a jail that turns all blood red. Your white blood has turned red like that of an ordinary human, so you can't use bloody energy anymore."<br><br>This Devil Prison turns all blood red. In other words, it was like hell for the blood demons of the White Blood Religion who gained strength through white blood.<br><br>"Impossible! This can't be!"<br><br>The 10th Apostle shouted that it was a power that disrupted the balance of the world.<br><br>"No, it's possible. As I said, you and the Leader of the White Blood Religion are the only ones I can use this sword domain on."<br><br>She had chosen to give up the possibility of opening a sword domain with elemental power alone like Rimmer, and instead created a sword domain solely for blood demons, specifically the 10th Apostle and the Leader of the White Blood Religion.<br><br>Moreover, she had made a soul oath that if she could kill those two with this sword domain, she would never wield a sword again. It was a restriction that sacrificed her future for the present, making such power not impossible to obtain.<br><br>'It might not work on the Leader of the White Blood Religion, but it will definitely work on the 10th Apostle.'<br><br>While she wasn't sure about the Leader of the White Blood Religion who was on a completely different level from her, the 10th Apostle would never be able to escape this prison.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>The 10th Apostle bit his lip and raised his spear. It seemed he was determined to fight until the end, even without bloody energy.<br><br>"That's a good stance. If you don't resist, there's no fun in taking revenge!"<br><br>As Martha raised her sword, the red blood flowing on the ground surged like a tidal wave and poured down over the 10th Apostle's head.<br><br>It was an enormous wave that seemed to engulf not just the 10th Apostle, but the entire Devil Prison space.<br><br>"Arghhhh!"<br><br>The 10th Apostle swung his spear shaft with a battle cry, but with only the strength of his body without bloody energy, he couldn't handle the powerful current entirely.<br><br>The 10th Apostle was swept away by the terrifying tidal wave, his arms and legs completely crushed as he was plunged into the red blood.<br><br>"It's not over yet."<br><br>As Martha thrust her sword into the ground, the blood turned into thousands of thorns, tearing into the 10th Apostle's entire body.<br><br>"Aaaaargh!"<br><br>Even the 10th Apostle couldn't endure the torture of the Devil Prison, rolling his eyes back and screaming.<br><br>"Do you regret it?"<br><br>Martha looked down at the 10th Apostle, who was trembling all over from the pain, and raised her chin.<br><br>"I asked if you regret choosing this path. Do you regret becoming a blood demon, killing innocent people, and kidnapping them!"<br><br>"Haa..."<br><br>The 10th Apostle raised his head, exhaling a breath that reeked of blood.<br><br>"I... I don't particularly enjoy fighting. I hardly ever drank human blood."<br><br>He continued speaking with trembling eyes.<br><br>"But I don't regret becoming a blood demon. My life was for Her, and She became stronger by obtaining your mother's body."<br><br>The 10th Apostle shook his head, seemingly pledging his loyalty to the Leader of the White Blood Religion until the very end.<br><br>"Is that so? Thank you. Thanks to you, I don't think I'll regret creating this sword domain either."<br><br>As Martha clenched her fist, the red blood turned into prison bars, wrapping around the 10th Apostle.<br><br>The 10th Apostle's bones were crushed as he was trapped in the blood bars that constricted his body like a snake. Red blood poured out from his mouth.<br><br>"Still..."<br><br>The 10th Apostle looked up at Martha, spitting out dead blood.<br><br>"I want to say I'm sorry to you..."<br><br>"To me? That's not right! You should be begging for forgiveness from all those you killed and sacrificed!"<br><br>Martha slapped the cheek of the 10th Apostle, who was turning blue, telling him not to talk nonsense.<br><br>"No, it's you. Only you..."<br><br>The 10th Apostle's eyes rolled up as if he was sorry only to her, and then he breathed his last.<br><br>"What does that..."<br><br>As Martha frowned, the 10th Apostle's corpse flowed with the blood and was mounted on the left side of the hell gate.<br><br>The remaining right side of the gate was reserved for the Leader of the White Blood Religion.<br><br>"Whatever happened, I won't accept your apology."<br><br>Martha bit her lip as she looked at the 10th Apostle's corpse, whose eyes hadn't closed in death.<br><br>"Because only the strong can forgive."<br><br>After staring at the 10th Apostle who had died with a bitter look contrary to his words of no regret, she grabbed the doorknob of the Devil Prison.<br><br>The door, covered in the 10th Apostle's blood, opened with a creaking sound like a ghost's wail, as if cursing her.<br><br>***<br><br>Martha's eyes widened as soon as she left the sword domain, hearing the cheers that erupted.<br><br>"As expected of our Division Leader!"<br><br>"You've finally achieved a sword domain!"<br><br>"I knew you could do it!"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen waved their hands at her, shouting with excitement.<br><br>"Martha!"<br><br>Burren raised his fist towards her.<br><br>"I can't believe you're the first among us to use a sword domain!"<br><br>He let out a laugh of disbelief. His words of "first" were filled with admiration and pride, not envy or jealousy.<br><br>"Well done! Really well done!"<br><br>Runaan curled the corners of her mouth very slightly. For her, that voice and smile were equivalent to roaring laughter.<br><br>"All our nieces and nephews are something else!"<br><br>Alice gave her a thumbs up after forcefully pushing back the First Apostle who was charging fiercely.<br><br>"The 10th Apostle..."<br><br>"D-Did he really die at the hands of that young girl?"<br><br>"I-Impossible! He was the 10th Apostle!"<br><br>"Even if it's a subordinate of that Raon Zieghart, how could such a young girl..."<br><br>On the other hand, the blood demons trembled with shock in their eyes as they realized the 10th Apostle had died.<br><br>"Martha."<br><br>Denier approached from behind and grabbed Martha's shoulder.<br><br>"How did you open the sword domain?"<br><br>He was staring at her with wide eyes, as if amazed.<br><br>"I learned about using elemental power for sword domains from that lazy master. It's a method possible without Zieghart's blood, but it's a martial art that's only the same in name, actually different in practice."<br><br>Martha smiled faintly, remembering Rimmer. Using it herself, she felt it was a bit different from Zieghart's sword domain.<br><br>"Also, seeing Raon use his sword domain often was a big help."<br><br>In fact, the oath to use it only against the 10th Apostle and the Leader of the White Blood Religion was significant, but she didn't mention that part, thinking it might make Denier sad.<br><br>"I see."<br><br>Denier nodded as if he now understood.<br><br>"Are you sure the 10th Apostle is dead?"<br><br>"Yes. He's definitely dead."<br><br>She clenched her fist, saying she had even embedded his corpse inside her sword domain so that not even his remains would be left.<br><br>"Then, did he leave any last words?"<br><br>Denier suddenly narrowed his eyes as if asking if the 10th Apostle had left any dying words.<br><br>"Well, he strangely said he was sorry only to me. He said such a weird thing... Ugh!"<br><br>Martha groaned and fell to her knees while explaining.<br><br>"Martha!"<br><br>Denier moved urgently to support Martha.<br><br>"I-I'm fine. Just a bit tired..."<br><br>Martha stood up, holding onto Denier's shoulder.<br><br>'So this is what it was.'<br><br>Offering one's life force... Rimmer had said he didn't want to recommend his sword domain because it consumed not just elemental power but also life force. True to his words, after using the sword domain, her whole body felt as if stabbed by knives, and she was hit with fatigue that made her want to collapse right there.<br><br>'Did he endure this?'<br><br>Realizing what pain Rimmer must have fought through, her tongue felt bitter to the point of stinging.<br><br>"Are you really alright?"<br><br>Denier frowned, seeming to have noticed her condition.<br><br>"I'm fine. No, even if I'm not fine, it can't be helped."<br><br>Martha stood on her two legs, using her sword as a cane.<br><br>"No matter what, we have to end this war today."<br><br>If they miss this opportunity, they might never be able to catch the Leader of the White Blood Religion again. Today, they must cut off that demon's neck and heart.<br><br>"Yes, that's true."<br><br>Denier nodded as if he understood her.<br><br>"Then stay behind me and replenish your strength. From now on, the Wise Martial Palace will pave the way."<br><br>He told her to follow from behind as he jumped over the wall.<br><br>"Thank you. Father."<br><br>Martha smiled faintly as she followed Denier into the White Blood Religion Headquarters.<br><br>"There are no blood demons?"<br><br>The interior of the headquarters was almost devoid of blood demons, as if they had all rushed to the walls.<br><br>"They're not absent."<br><br>Denier pointed his finger at the wide road where white blood was flowing. Scattered along the expansive path were countless corpses of blood demons, archbishops, and what appeared to be the body of an apostle.<br><br>"The Light Wind Palace Master cut through all of this."<br><br>He let out a dry laugh as he looked at the sword marks left by Raon, who had cut through the blood demons' windpipes without a single error. He seemed genuinely impressed by Raon's martial prowess.<br><br>"Judging by how crudely he plowed through, it must be him."<br><br>Martha nodded as she looked at the apostle's corpse that bore traces of Raon's handiwork.<br><br>'I feel a bit stronger.'<br><br>Thinking that Raon was fighting for her sake, she felt the fatigue and pain weighing on her body and mind lighten a little.<br><br>"It seems he went north. Let's pick up the pace from here."<br><br>"Alright."<br><br>As they followed Denier and the swordsmen of the Wise Martial Palace, they were running forward when suddenly, a massive pillar of bloody energy shot up from the white cathedral at the northern end. It was as if the largest waterfall in the world, the Blancor Falls, were rising in reverse.<br><br>"The Leader of the White Blood Religion!"<br><br>Martha gritted her teeth as she saw the black-haired, black-eyed woman emerging from the pillar of bloody energy. The Leader of the White Blood Religion. She was glaring at the sky, wrapped in white blood like a dress.<br><br>Just as she was about to run towards the Leader of the White Blood Religion, clenching her sword-wielding hand, a golden-haired swordsman in front of her was pushed back by the bloody energy and crashed into the building next to her.<br><br>"She's disgustingly strong even without awakening."<br><br>It was Raon. He let out a dry laugh as he got up, clearing away the collapsed building debris.<br><br>"Raon!"<br><br>"Seeing you've made it this far, I guess you succeeded."<br><br>Raon gave her a faint smile, as if he had believed in her.<br><br>"What happened?"<br><br>"That queen mosquito was trying to use her underlings as meat shields and awaken. I stopped her at the last moment."<br><br>He dusted off his hands covered in blood and dirt, saying he had prevented the Leader of the White Blood Religion's awakening by a paper-thin margin.<br><br>"I was so close! Just one breath away, and you...!"<br><br>Raon's words were true, as the Leader of the White Blood Religion screamed, clutching her black hair.<br><br>"I'll kill you! Not just you, but everyone connected to you, I'll devour them all!"<br><br>As the Leader of the White Blood Religion chanted a spell with her hands clasped, a pure white dimension sprouted from within the White Blood Religion Headquarters, and countless blood demons poured out. In an instant, the interior of the headquarters was filled with blood demons, as if she had summoned all the blood demons existing on this continent.<br><br>However, the Leader of the White Blood Religion's spell didn't stop there. She sprinkled white blood rain over the headquarters, weakening the Zieghart swordsmen and empowering the blood demons.<br><br>Once again, the tide of battle reversed, and the swordsmen began to be pushed back.<br><br>"I'll kill you myself..."<br><br>Just as the Leader of the White Blood Religion was about to reach out her hand, saying she would kill him personally, a blue sword strike split the space where she stood and pierced through her chest.<br><br>"You seem quite agitated."<br><br>King Lecross, the king of Owen and known as the Silent Sword Master, walked out of a space that reflected like a mirror. He poured aura into the sword that had pierced the Leader of the White Blood Religion's chest, bursting her flesh and bones.<br><br>"Cough!"<br><br>The moment the Leader of the White Blood Religion bent over, spitting blood, dozens of cards fell from the air, showering her with high-level magic composed of lightning.<br><br>"Arghhhh!"<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion crashed to the ground with a scream as powerful aura and magic exploded.<br><br>"Well done."<br><br>Mage Tower Master Larian winked at Raon, who had cards of different colors flickering between his fingers.<br><br>"I was watching with bated breath, and you really did well."<br><br>King Lecross also nodded at Raon and Martha, saying they had done excellently.<br><br>"Now we'll join in too!"<br><br>As he raised his hand, Chamber's blue dimensional gate opened, and Owen's knights rushed out. The cavalry, with their lances sharpened and tucked at their waists, swept through the blood demons, while the knight order led by the Third Prince cut through the dimensions from which the blood demons were emerging, clearing a path.<br><br>"Benefactor! Sorry to keep you waiting!"<br><br>The Third Prince raised his sword dripping with blood demons' blood, greeting them as if he too had been struggling to hold back from joining the fight.<br><br>"It's been a while. I can't even keep up with you anymore."<br><br>Borini Kitten, who had become the vice-captain of the Silver Knights, smiled gently as he slit an archbishop's throat.<br><br>"You bastards..."<br><br>"It's not over yet."<br><br>As the Leader of the White Blood Religion struggled to steady herself due to the shock from Lecross and Larian's attacks, Raon stepped forward on the Supreme Harmony Steps and punched her in the face. Unable to recover from the earlier impact, the Leader of the White Blood Religion couldn't block Raon's attack and rolled on the ground, collapsing in front of Larian and Lecross.<br><br>King Lecross pointed his glowing blue sword at the Leader of the White Blood Religion, Larian raised her cards and drew in enormous mana, and Raon opened his sword domain with the Heavenly Drive and Blade of Requiem, summoning the Divine Sword and Demonic Sword.<br><br>"Being crumpled up suits you well."<br><br>Raon curled his lips as he looked at the Leader of the White Blood Religion's cheek, which was turning purple with bruises.<br><br>"After all, you have to swat mosquitoes with your palm."</p>
