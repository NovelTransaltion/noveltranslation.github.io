        <p>After informing the residents of the annex building of his intention to leave for Habun Castle, Raon immediately headed to the Lord's Manor.<br><br>"Oh!"<br><br>Roenn, who was cleaning the Lord's Manor, widened his eyes upon seeing him.<br><br>"You've come back."<br><br>He chuckled, seemingly not expecting Raon to visit so soon.<br><br>"I have something to discuss with the Head of House."<br><br>Raon stood before the audience chamber door, adjusting his attire.<br><br>"Please go in."<br><br>Roenn moved to open the door, indicating that Glenn was inside the audience chamber.<br><br>"No, I'll do it myself."<br><br>Raon grasped the handle himself and opened the door to the audience chamber. The door swung open smoothly as if oiled, revealing the chamber bathed in evening twilight.<br><br>Under the vivid purple glow of sunset, Glenn sat on the throne. With his eyes closed, he emanated an otherworldly mystique and noble presence.<br><br>'What is this...?'<br><br>Raon swallowed hard as he looked at Glenn.<br><br>'Grandfather is...'<br><br>It felt as if he had vanished from this world. Though Glenn was clearly present before him, he appeared hazy, as if existing elsewhere. Yet there was no sense of malevolence or hostility. Instead, a mysterious aura emanated from him, making it impossible to even speak.<br><br>-Hoh?<br><br>Wrath let out a deep exclamation.<br><br>-Every time I see him, I can't help but think that old man is truly an interesting human.<br><br>He nodded, impressed by the extraordinary sight.<br><br>'What do you mean...'<br><br>Just as Raon was about to ask Wrath about Glenn's condition.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Glenn slowly lifted his eyelids as if sensing Raon's gaze. As his eyes matched the color of the sunset, the mysterious aura that had filled the audience chamber instantly dissipated.<br><br>"I apologize. I was lost in thought for a moment."<br><br>Glenn raised his hand to brush back his disheveled hair. He seemed to return to this world, displaying his usual solemn demeanor.<br><br>"...No need to apologize."<br><br>Raon shook his head as he entered the audience chamber.<br><br>'Words won't come out.'<br><br>Though he wanted to ask Glenn what had happened, strangely, he couldn't open his mouth, fearing Glenn might vanish like a bubble.<br><br>"Well then. What brings you here?"<br><br>Glenn lowered his gaze with a faint smile.<br><br>"I intend to leave the family for a while."<br><br>Raon bowed his head to Glenn and stated his reason for coming to the audience chamber.<br><br>"Leave the family?"<br><br>Glenn's eyes narrowed slightly.<br><br>"Did you not attend today's conference?"<br><br>His expression showed that he couldn't understand why Raon would leave at such a crucial moment when they were selecting a successor.<br><br>"No, I heard everything."<br><br>Raon shook his head, explaining that he had properly listened from behind a pillar.<br><br>"There are just things I need to do first."<br><br>With Derus potentially starting a war at any moment, he needed to meet with the demon kings as soon as possible to convince them to stop the Archangel. While the position of head of house was appealing, he wanted to defeat Derus and save Zieghart and this continent first.<br><br>"I know better than anyone how impressive your achievements are."<br><br>Glenn placed his hand on the armrest.<br><br>"There probably hasn't been anyone in Zieghart's history who has accumulated achievements faster than you. However..."<br><br>His gaze grew cold.<br><br>"If you let your guard down too much, you could be overtaken."<br><br>"What do you..."<br><br>"Considering the difficulty of earning a Golden Tablet, it wouldn't be strange to count it as 5 points, but I set Bronze Tablets as 1 point, Silver Tablets as 2 points, and Golden Tablets as 3 points."<br><br>Glenn tapped the throne's armrest with his fingers as if playing piano.<br><br>"So you did that intentionally."<br><br>Raon's eyebrows lowered slightly.<br><br>'I thought something was odd.'<br><br>While Bronze and Silver Tablets were often awarded for completing minor tasks, Golden Tablets were only given to swordsmen who showed exceptional achievements or to leaders who guided them. He had thought the points for Golden Tablets were too low, but that had been Glenn's intention all along.<br><br>"Indeed. Though you've accumulated much until now, you could be overtaken during this brief period of selecting a successor."<br><br>Glenn nodded, confirming that he had lowered the points for Golden Tablets with this in mind.<br><br>"May I ask the reason?"<br><br>Raon exhaled heavily as he looked at Glenn.<br><br>"Because I want you all to compete and surpass each other."<br><br>Glenn calmly lowered his chin.<br><br>"A sword becomes sharper the more it's hammered, and harder the more it's tempered in fire."<br><br>He hoped the swordsmen would grow through the successor competition. It seemed he wanted not just to select an heir, but to strengthen the entire family.<br><br>"Moreover, in the process of finding and completing missions on their own, they can build not just martial prowess, but also mental fortitude and experience."<br><br>Glenn closed and opened his eyes, indicating he had prepared the successor selection test with all of this in mind.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>Raon let out a short, wry laugh.<br><br>"Grandfather, you never do anything without purpose."<br><br>He had suspected there were hidden intentions, but he hadn't realized they went this far. He still seemed far inferior to Glenn.<br><br>"You too will be capable when you reach this position. No, you'll do better than anyone else."<br><br>Glenn smiled softly as if he could already see it happening.<br><br>"However, I can't force you. It's your choice, so I'll accept it. Go ahead and return when you're ready."<br><br>He waved his hand, indicating he wouldn't oppose Raon's decision.<br><br>"Thank you. Though it may be a different path, I won't disappoint you."<br><br>Raon bowed deeply to Glenn before leaving the audience chamber.<br><br>"Whatever you do, wherever you go..."<br><br>Glenn smiled gently as he looked at the door through which Raon had left.<br><br>"I believe in you."<br><br>With those final words, he closed his eyes again. The mysterious presence from before was gone. Only the cold winter wind tapped against the windows.<br><br>***<br><br>On a night when the moon hung high.<br><br>"Why this sudden gathering in the middle of the night?"<br><br>Krein tilted his head as he looked around at the Light Wind Palace swordsmen gathered before the platform.<br><br>"I don't know..."<br><br>Dorian rubbed his sleepy eyes and smacked his lips.<br><br>"It's about the successor test."<br><br>Burren straightened his back as he stood before Dorian and Krein.<br><br>"The other martial divisions are already moving to find or create missions."<br><br>He nodded, saying that the Light Wind Palace should also prepare missions for Raon.<br><br>"I don't really understand what's going on..."<br><br>Runaan yawned widely, appearing completely clueless and very sleepy.<br><br>"We have to do it even if we don't understand."<br><br>Martha clenched her fist as she firmly patted Runaan's back.<br><br>"We must do whatever we can for him."<br><br>She showed a determined expression as if willing to risk her life for Raon.<br><br>"That's right."<br><br>Mark Goetun nodded with a serious look, seeming to share Martha's sentiment.<br><br>"Is-is this really winter? What's with this heat... ugh!"<br><br>Dorian nearly fell backward as he retreated in fear.<br><br>"What are you doing?"<br><br>Krein frowned as he grabbed Dorian's shoulder.<br><br>"I-I don't know. My legs suddenly went weak."<br><br>Dorian let out a nervous breath, saying he didn't understand what was happening either.<br><br>"And you call yourself a Master when you can't even stand properly."<br><br>Just as Krein was about to hit the back of Dorian's head while snorting in derision, Raon burst through the door into the training ground with a thunderous sound.<br><br>"Everyone's here."<br><br>He quickly surveyed the Light Wind Palace swordsmen as he stepped onto the platform.<br><br>"I have something to tell you all."<br><br>Raon looked down at the Light Wind Palace swordsmen while gripping the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>"We already know!"<br><br>Krein quickly raised his hand, indicating there was no need to explain.<br><br>"You want us to create or find missions, right? Don't worry! I, Krein, the real power and assault leader of the Light Wind Palace, will go right now and..."<br><br>He grinned, openly showing his desire to impress Raon.<br><br>"That's not it."<br><br>Raon firmly shook his head.<br><br>"Pardon?"<br><br>"That's not it?"<br><br>"If not missions, then what?"<br><br>Not just Krein, but all the other swordsmen widened their eyes in surprise at Raon's response.<br><br>"I'll be going to Habun Castle with Yua and Julius. You all should complete as many missions as possible."<br><br>Raon rotated his wrist as if warming up, acting as if it wasn't a big deal.<br><br>"G-going to Habun Castle?"<br><br>Burren's lips trembled.<br><br>"Hey! Why are you leaving at such a crucial moment!"<br><br>He shouted, speaking informally to Raon for the first time in a long while.<br><br>"I see..."<br><br>Runaan blinked and nodded as if understanding, though she seemed to be half-asleep already.<br><br>"H-he's serious! He really intends to leave without doing any missions!"<br><br>Dorian's jaw dropped as he read Raon's mind. He took a sharp breath in disbelief.<br><br>"You have a reason?"<br><br>Martha calmly asked the question, appearing to trust Raon's words.<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>"Alright then."<br><br>She nodded while crossing her arms, as if that was all she needed to hear.<br><br>"You can't just end it with 'alright'! This isn't just anything, it's about becoming successor!"<br><br>Burren stomped his foot hard, telling them to come to their senses.<br><br>"My father has already prepared to go out and find missions!"<br><br>He was so frustrated that he even revealed Karoon's movements.<br><br>"Then you do it."<br><br>Raon extended his hand toward the Light Wind Palace members.<br><br>"What? Us?"<br><br>"What do you mean..."<br><br>"W-what should we do?"<br><br>The swordsmen blinked at each other in confusion, not understanding.<br><br>"I want you to participate in the successor competition. Find missions, complete them, and earn Zieghart's tablets."<br><br>Raon clapped his hands as he told them to participate in the successor competition in his place.<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>Burren's eyes shook violently as if they had turned into question marks.<br><br>"U-us becoming successor?"<br><br>Krein's jaw dropped as well.<br><br>"How can we participate in the competition! We're far behind in both achievements and ability!"<br><br>Trevin shook his head, saying it was absolutely impossible.<br><br>"That's why you need to face it. Even if you fail, you'll gain something. This successor test isn't just a simple selection. The Head of House..."<br><br>Raon relayed to the Light Wind Palace swordsmen what he had heard from Glenn in the audience chamber.<br><br>"I see."<br><br>Burren nodded, finally understanding Raon's intention.<br><br>"Competing like that would definitely lead to growth. As expected of the Head of House."<br><br>Martha let out a breath, amazed at Glenn's intentions.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Runaan's head bobbed as she dozed off, making soft snoring sounds.<br><br>"Of course, you're right. Even if we ignore achievements, your abilities are still lacking. But there's no need to worry. That's why I'm here."<br><br>Raon curled his lips while revealing a cold glint in his eyes.<br><br>"N-no way..."<br><br>Krein's jaw trembled as he finally sensed something ominous.<br><br>"Your fears are correct. I'll give you very special training until I leave."<br><br>Raon smiled brightly, saying they could look forward to training like before the war.<br><br>"Ugh..."<br><br>"W-we're doing that again?"<br><br>"I'd rather die! Just stab me now!"<br><br>The moment they heard "special training," the swordsmen crawled on the ground like conditioned dogs, drooling.<br><br>"I wondered why we hadn't done this yet..."<br><br>Burren let out a deep sigh as if he had somewhat expected this.<br><br>"True. We have rested a lot."<br><br>Martha clenched and unclenched her fist as if preparing herself.<br><br>"N-no..."<br><br>Even in her sleep, Runaan's lips moved like a baby bird's, saying she didn't want special training.<br><br>"Finally! I've been waiting for this!"<br><br>Trevin immediately drew his sword, seeming pleased.<br><br>"Aaagh! I knew I had a bad feeling..."<br><br>Dorian clutched his head, saying this explained why his legs had gone weak.<br><br>"Then we'll start with..."<br><br>"Eek!"<br><br>Krein stepped forward with a sniffle, as if sensing his fate.<br><br>"Krein. You're for later."<br><br>Raon gestured not to Krein but to Dorian.<br><br>"Dorian, since you're coming with me, let's get your beating—no, training—done first."<br><br>"Y-you just said beating, not training..."<br><br>"It's your imagination. Come here."<br><br>His smile suggested it wasn't imagination at all as he beckoned with a murderous grin.<br><br>"Ah, and Krein, I'll save you for last. I'll use all my remaining strength to make you stronger."<br><br>After making a gesture filled with killing intent toward Krein, Raon walked toward Dorian.<br><br>"Aaaaargh!"<br><br>"Urrrrrgh!"<br><br>The screams of the first and last swordsmen to be trained echoed roughly through the night training ground.<br><br>***<br><br>"Are you ready?"<br><br>Raon gestured to Yua, who was cutely wearing a backpack.<br><br>"Yes! All ready!"<br><br>Yua nodded while patting her backpack as if saying not to worry.<br><br>"Raon. Why aren't you asking me?"<br><br>Evelyn frowned, wearing a small bag diagonally across her body.<br><br>"Am I invisible?"<br><br>She thrust her flushed face forward as if demanding a quick response.<br><br>"A-are you ready?"<br><br>Raon quickly spoke while leaning his upper body backward.<br><br>"Call me by my name."<br><br>"E-Evelyn. Are you ready...?"<br><br>"Yes! All ready! All I need is you."<br><br>Evelyn smiled brightly, saying Raon was all she needed to prepare.<br><br>"Uh..."<br><br>Raon swallowed dryly as he stepped further away from Evelyn.<br><br>-Ughh...<br><br>Wrath foamed at the mouth in shock, even though Evelyn hadn't startled him.<br><br>'I'm having an increasingly hard time getting used to this.'<br><br>He felt tense every moment as Evelyn seemed to have completely lost any sense of personal space.<br><br>"L-let's go."<br><br>Raon opened the door of the annex building, already feeling deeply tired despite not having departed yet.<br><br>"Have a safe trip."<br><br>Sylvia, who was in the garden, waved her hand, telling them to take good care of Yua and Julius.<br><br>"Don't stay away too long."<br><br>Edgar nodded, telling them to return quickly.<br><br>"Mother, Father, don't worry. I'm here! If he doesn't want to come back, I'll drag him back!"<br><br>Evelyn grinned, saying she would handle everything.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>"Y-yes. Please do..."<br><br>Sylvia and Edgar quickly responded while averting their eyes, seeming uncomfortable with Evelyn.<br><br>"Have a safe journey."<br><br>Judiel bowed, wishing them a pleasant journey.<br><br>"Raon! Bring me back a present!"<br><br>Sia waved, saying she would be waiting.<br><br>"Yeah. I'll be back."<br><br>Raon smiled as he took Sia's hand.<br><br>'Big sister has changed a lot too.'<br><br>He had actually planned to take Sia on this journey too, but she voluntarily stayed behind, saying she was enjoying her swordsmanship training. It seemed she had completely moved past her rebellious phase.<br><br>"We'll be back."<br><br>Raon bowed to his family before leaving the annex building with Evelyn, Sia, and Julius.<br><br>"Sh-should I carry that for you?"<br><br>Julius glanced sideways as he reached for Yua's bag.<br><br>"It's fine. It's light!"<br><br>Yua smiled as she declined his offer.<br><br>"I-I was just offering..."<br><br>Julius lowered his eyes in disappointment when his brave offer was rejected.<br><br>"With us like this, doesn't it feel like we're going on a couples' trip, two and two?"<br><br>Evelyn clapped her hands, saying the atmosphere was perfect.<br><br>"C-couples? No way! Absolutely not!"<br><br>Julius shook his head vigorously, protesting against being seen that way with Yua.<br><br>"That's right! I see it that way too!"<br><br>Yua nodded, saying she understood what Evelyn meant.<br><br>"Stop saying such childish things... Huh? R-really?"<br><br>Julius was about to protest against such nonsense, but his expression brightened at Yua's words.<br><br>"Do you really think that..."<br><br>"Of course not us though!"<br><br>Yua waved her hands, saying that wasn't the case for them.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>Julius's brightened expression darkened again.<br><br>"Whew."<br><br>Raon let out a sigh of relief.<br><br>'What a relief. At least those two are cute.'<br><br>He had thought the journey would be suffocating because of Evelyn, but thanks to Yua and Julius, it might be a bit enjoyable.<br><br>"We have a long way to go, let's hurry."<br><br>Raon led the three toward Zieghart's main gate. As they approached the walls to request External Commander Illiune to open the gate, he spotted a familiar figure.<br><br>"Darkan?"<br><br>Raon's eyes widened as he saw Darkan leaning against the wall with his arms crossed.<br><br>"Why are you here..."<br><br>"I've been waiting for you."<br><br>"For me? You could have come to the annex building then."<br><br>"Because I need to leave too."<br><br>Darkan rotated his ankle, saying it was time for him to leave Zieghart as well.<br><br>"I was waiting because there's something I need to tell you first. Raon Zieghart, you..."<br><br>He placed his hand on the hilt of his dark sword while looking at him.<br><br>"Do you know about the secret of the holy ground?"</p>
