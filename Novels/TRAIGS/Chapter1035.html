        <p>Raon brushed back his blood-soaked hair and looked up. The red wolf's doppelgangers that had been tearing at his flesh vanished into transparent droplets, and the crimson sea that seemed to flow with blood regained its original emerald hue.<br><br>'The sea has returned to normal.'<br><br>He let out a sigh as he gazed at the sea that had regained its blue color. He had only intended to save the wolf, so he hadn't expected the sea to be purified as well.<br><br>-Why are you surprised by that?<br><br>Wrath frowned as he looked up at Raon.<br><br>-It's only natural that everything returns to normal since you erased the seed of that damned Blood Demon woman who was the root of all this trouble.<br><br>He nodded grandly, praising him.<br><br>'I see.'<br><br>Raon smiled faintly as he felt the pure energy of Rimmer in the breeze.<br><br>'But it seems the wolf has disappeared too.'<br><br>He narrowed his eyes as he grasped the Blade of Requiem that had returned to him.<br><br>'It shouldn't have died.'<br><br>He had thought the wolf would remain since he had completely cut away the bloody energy of the White Blood Religion's leader with his Soul Sword, but nothing existed before his eyes except the sea.<br><br>-It endured that terrible bloody energy for so long. It might be resting from exhaustion or have fainted.<br><br>Wrath waved his hand, insisting it must still be alive.<br><br>-Forget about that spirit and think about yourself first.<br><br>'I suppose...'<br><br>Raon smiled coldly as he looked at his body covered in blood.<br><br>'My body is in tatters.'<br><br>He had sustained internal injuries and severe external wounds from fighting eight wolves with transcendent-level bloody energy. Only his mind remained intact.<br><br>'My mind isn't just intact, it's in peak condition.'<br><br>Perhaps because his soul had ascended and his mastery of the Soul Sword had improved, his mind remained calm despite the long battle with the wolves and the pain coursing through his entire body.<br><br>-Of course...<br><br>Wrath bared his teeth at Raon.<br><br>-This time you received rewards while fighting!<br><br>He growled as if in disbelief.<br><br>'What do you mean?'<br><br>Raon blinked as he looked at the angry Wrath.<br><br>-Didn't you know? Reward messages popped up while you were fighting that spirit!<br><br>'I didn't see them. I was completely focused on the battle.'<br><br>He had been so focused on the fight before him, wanting to save the wolf's soul, that he hadn't even noticed the reward messages appearing.<br><br>-This guy's luck is just...<br><br>'I'll check now.'<br><br>Raon took a short breath and called up the unread messages.<br><br>[The level of the trait has increased.]<br><br>[The level of the trait has increased.]<br><br>[The traits and are evolving in conjunction.]<br><br>[A new trait has been created.]<br><br>[The level of the trait has increased.]<br><br>As Wrath had said, there really were reward messages he hadn't seen.<br><br>'So it wasn't my senses improving that allowed me to find the wolf's soul.'<br><br>Raon chuckled wryly as he checked each reward message.<br><br>'Azure Clear Eye, huh.'<br><br>He could definitely feel a new sense. As if he had truly opened the eyes of his heart, he could now perceive the wolf's soul and the White Blood Religion leader's bloody energy with his own eyes and soul.<br><br>'I didn't know traits could evolve in conjunction like this.'<br><br> was a trait created by combining and . He never imagined traits could not only evolve but evolve in conjunction.<br><br>-E-even I have never seen such a thing...<br><br>Wrath chewed his lips.<br><br>'You've never seen it either?'<br><br>-That's what I'm saying! This damned system must have done something!<br><br>He bristled, his tail quivering as if it had been created without his consent.<br><br>'Whatever the reason for its creation, it's clearly a special power.'<br><br> was an ability that made the invisible visible and allowed one to sense the imperceptible. It was truly an upgrade to and , which made him nothing but happy.<br><br>'It seems I could use this for more than just combat.'<br><br>Raon smiled faintly as he looked at the last message.<br><br>'The growth of the Soul Sword.'<br><br>In fact, he had felt the Soul Sword grow even without seeing this message. When it came to swordsmanship, his own senses were more accurate than the system.<br><br>-Grrrr...<br><br>Wrath rolled his eyes up and down as he ground his teeth.<br><br>'You're not as angry as I expected.'<br><br>Raon tilted his head as he looked at Wrath.<br><br>'I thought you'd throw a fit like before.'<br><br>-I'm pissed about the new trait, but...<br><br>Wrath wrinkled his nose as he looked at Raon.<br><br>-Those rewards weren't created by my power, but something you earned yourself.<br><br>'Something I earned myself?'<br><br>-That's right. Unlike when you receive other reward messages, this time I didn't feel my main body's power being torn away. This is...<br><br>He raised his hand to point at Raon.<br><br>-Power you obtained directly yourself.<br><br>Wrath's eyes trembled as he said this was truly the first time he'd seen such a thing.<br><br>'Power I obtained directly...'<br><br>-Just what are you...<br><br>As Wrath sighed and approached, suddenly:<br><br>[You have saved the sea spirit that was submerged in blood.]<br><br>[You have achieved a great feat.]<br><br>[All abilities increase by 30 points.]<br><br>[The level of the trait has increased.]<br><br>[The level of the trait has increased.]<br><br>[The level of the trait has increased.]<br><br>[The level of the trait has increased.]<br><br>[The level of the trait has increased.]<br><br>Suddenly, reward messages popped up one after another.<br><br>-Huh?<br><br>Wrath blinked blankly, as if he hadn't expected new reward messages to appear.<br><br>-W-what is this? Why are there more rewards!<br><br>He shouted that it should be over as he swatted at the messages.<br><br>'You said it yourself.'<br><br>Raon waved his outstretched palm at Wrath.<br><br>'The previous messages were ones I earned myself. These must be gifts from the system.'<br><br>He smiled as he said that's why they appeared after everything was over.<br><br>-T-this damned...<br><br>Wrath's eyes trembled as if he had been caught completely off guard.<br><br>-Why does this happen every time I open my mouth! I really can't take it anymore!<br><br>He screamed his intense anger at the dark, rippling night sky.<br><br>'Here we go again.'<br><br>As Raon shook his head and cleared the messages he had checked, suddenly...The night sea rippling with blue light surged slightly, and a small wolf leapt out like a dolphin. It was the original form of the sea spirit he had seen when it was being injected with magic by the White Blood Religion's leader.<br><br>"Kheung!"<br><br>The sea spirit made a nasal sound as if in a good mood and approached him.<br><br>"Are you alright now?"<br><br>Raon knelt on one knee and stroked the spirit's head. It didn't feel like touching an animal, but like brushing against soft waves. It seemed to have returned to being a spirit again.<br><br>"Kyarung."<br><br>The sea spirit bowed its head as if in gratitude and licked the blood dripping from his fingers. At that moment, a cool watery energy began to seep into his body, starting to heal the wounds all over his body. No, it wasn't just healing his wounds. Natural mana was flowing into his body.<br><br>"You..."<br><br>"Kreung!"<br><br>The sea spirit raised its front paw to hold his hand, as if telling him to stay still. It seemed to be trying to transfer the mana possessed by the sea to him as thanks for saving it.<br><br>"I'm fine, take care of yourself first."<br><br>Raon tried to pull his hand away, saying it was unnecessary, but the wolf clung to his arm like a cicada on a tree and wouldn't let go. Finally, after transferring mana superior to even the highest grade elixir and healing all his external wounds, the wolf released his arm. It was a stubborn creature.<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>Raon stroked the sea spirit's forehead, thanking it for such a gift.<br><br>"Kyarrrr."<br><br>The sea spirit laughed as if pleased, then tilted its head.<br><br>"Do you want me to give you my hand again?"<br><br>Raon held out his hand, but the sea spirit shook its head as if that wasn't it.<br><br>"Then what..."<br><br>"Kyawung."<br><br>The sea spirit raised its adorable front paw to point at its own forehead.<br><br>"You want me to bump heads?"<br><br>"Kyawung!"<br><br>It nodded as if to say that was correct.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Though he hesitated slightly, seeing the spirit's clear eyes, he lowered his head a little. The spirit leapt up from the sea and bumped its forehead against his. With a cool sensation like water droplets touching his head, a new scene flashed in his mind.<br><br>"This is..."<br><br>***<br><br>Lawaine raised his head after cutting down the Giant Crab, a monster in the form of a massive crab, with a single strike. He let out a sigh as he looked at the sea glowing blue despite the dark night.<br><br>"I can't believe he actually did it..."<br><br>When he saw the red wolves emitting transcendent-level aura increase to eight, he had thought even Raon couldn't win and prepared to retreat. But Raon not only endured, he erased the bloody energy filling the sea and saved the wolf's soul.<br><br>'He's a monster, that's the only way to describe him.'<br><br>He had been paralyzed by just one wolf's howl, so he couldn't help but marvel at Raon's immense martial prowess and unbreakable spirit.<br><br>"You still don't know our Palace Master."<br><br>Burren snorted as he sliced an approaching creature in half.<br><br>"That man doesn't even start things he can't accomplish."<br><br>He nodded calmly, saying Raon had gone out with the certainty that he could win.<br><br>"Mm..."<br><br>Runaan blinked in agreement.<br><br>"Today Raon is handsome so everything works out..."<br><br>She froze monsters with ice barriers without even looking at the sea, as if there was no need to worry about Raon today.<br><br>"That's right."<br><br>Martha chuckled as she leaned on her sword like a cane.<br><br>"I knew he'd do it."<br><br>Raon could have crushed the red wolf with brute force and killed it, but he chose the path of salvation after hearing her words. Seeing him now face to face with the spirit that had returned to its original form after he succeeded, her eyes and nose burned hot.<br><br>'He made that decision for my sake.'<br><br>Raon must have made such an attempt not just to save the wolf, but as a practical exercise to save her mother whose soul was captured by the White Blood Religion's leader. His feelings washed over her like a sea breeze, unknowingly blurring her vision.<br><br>"Thank you so mu-"<br><br>As Martha was about to thank Raon with reddened nose, suddenly Raon and the sea spirit vanished from sight. The monsters in front of the Light Wind Palace swordsmen were split in half, and Raon walked out from behind them.<br><br>"Sir Lawaine."<br><br>Raon called out to Lawaine, who had widened his eyes in surprise.<br><br>"Yes? Ah, yes!"<br><br>Lawaine swallowed dryly and bowed.<br><br>"Is this the end of our business here?"<br><br>"Y-yes, I believe so?"<br><br>He nodded, saying they had obtained the White Blood Religion's ship, saved the spirit, and killed the apostle, so everything was finished.<br><br>"Then let's return to Zieghart."<br><br>Raon clenched his fist until veins popped out as he turned his ominously sunken eyes.<br><br>"There's something I need to report as quickly as possible."<br><br>***<br><br>"I was wondering why there was no news for a while..."<br><br>Glenn turned his gaze to the window as his legs trembled.<br><br>"I didn't expect him to return so soon."<br><br>Raon had cut off contact after saying he would go undercover to find the culprit who destroyed the port and village. Glenn had been so worried he couldn't sleep well, but he hadn't expected Raon to return so suddenly.<br><br>"When did he say he'd arrive?"<br><br>"He said he just passed the Shadow Agents, so he should be here soon."<br><br>Roenn laughed, saying he'd be here any moment.<br><br>"Ugh, he could have given us some advance notice."<br><br>He regretted not being able to gather the executives to hear about Raon's exploits, as his grandson was rushing in so urgently.<br><br>"We can listen first and then call everyone to hear the story again."<br><br>Sheryl smiled, asking what was there to worry about.<br><br>"Ahem! That's true!"<br><br>Glenn stroked his chin slightly as if he'd had the same thought.<br><br>"Hehehe."<br><br>"Hoho."<br><br>Sheryl and Roenn smiled gently, as if just seeing Glenn happy made them happy too.<br><br>"Well then, let's get ready."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Understood."<br><br>As the three were tidying their clothes and hair while waiting for the Light Wind Palace to report their return, a heavy knock sounded on the audience chamber door.<br><br>"Enter."<br><br>Glenn nodded, expecting to see Raon's confident stride bringing news of victory as always. The audience chamber doors slowly opened and Raon and the Light Wind Palace swordsmen entered. However, rather than the proud eyes of those who had completed a mission, they wore stiff expressions.<br><br>"...Don't tell me you failed?"<br><br>Glenn let out a low groan at the unexpected situation.<br><br>"No. We caught the culprit and identified the mastermind behind it."<br><br>Raon shook his head, saying they had successfully completed the mission.<br><br>"Mastermind?"<br><br>Glenn lowered his eyebrows as he looked at Raon, who hadn't even wiped off the sea's fishy smell.<br><br>"The mastermind behind this incident is the White Blood Religion. Thanks to the spirit they used..."<br><br>Raon took a deep breath and raised his gaze. He parted his cracked lips and his red eyes flashed like flames.<br><br>"We've found the location of the White Blood Religion's headquarters."</p>
