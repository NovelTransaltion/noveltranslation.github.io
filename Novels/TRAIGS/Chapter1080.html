        <p>"M-Merit?"<br><br>Balder's thick lips trembled.<br><br>"Surely you don't mean to calculate performance based on the number of Golden Tablets?"<br><br>He nervously swallowed as he looked at the Golden, Silver, and Bronze Tablets in Glenn's grasp.<br><br>"That's exactly right."<br><br>Karoon unfolded his arms and lowered both hands.<br><br>"Those Zieghart tablets are the clear and objective measure of our achievements thus far."<br><br>He nodded, stating that only the Zieghart tablets could provide such detailed evaluation of their performance.<br><br>'Merits...'<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes while touching the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>'It's certainly the most efficient and convenient way.'<br><br>Since this was the first test, examining performance records was merely a way to weed out the unworthy. Though simple, it was a method no one could object to, making it the perfect choice for the first test.<br><br>"Question!"<br><br>Darkan, who had entered the audience chamber at some unknown point, raised his hand.<br><br>"Who is that person really?"<br><br>"Is he a new subordinate of the Head of House?"<br><br>"He seems to be from the Light Wind Palace..."<br><br>People looked back and forth between Darkan and Glenn with questioning gazes.<br><br>"..."<br><br>However, Glenn ignored Darkan and looked at the executives.<br><br>"As the True Martial Palace Master said."<br><br>Glenn flicked his finger, making the Golden, Silver, and Bronze Tablets float in the air.<br><br>"These tablets were given to swordsmen individually based on the difficulty and results of their missions. In other words, they're the best means to judge the achievements you've accumulated."<br><br>His red eyes flashed as he moved the Golden Tablet to the front.<br><br>"The Head of Zieghart is both the last wall protecting the family and the first sword to strike down enemies. We cannot place someone in that position who hasn't risked their life to achieve greatness for the family."<br><br>Glenn put the tablets back in his grasp, stating that the first test would only look at performance records.<br><br>"Come to think of it, that makes sense."<br><br>"It's right that those who sacrificed for the family should become the Head of House."<br><br>"As expected of the Head of House. He presents a test that no one can object to from the start."<br><br>The family executives nodded in succession, agreeing it was the right approach.<br><br>"I have a question!"<br><br>Darkan raised his hand again.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Glenn ignored him again.<br><br>"W-What? Am I the only one who can see him?"<br><br>"No, I can see him too..."<br><br>"What's their relationship anyway?"<br><br>The executives observed Darkan with even more suspicion.<br><br>"Raon!"<br><br>Alice suddenly called out to him.<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>"I accumulated quite a few tablets when I was younger, you know?"<br><br>She waggled her finger at him.<br><br>"Want them?"<br><br>Alice grinned brightly, seeming completely serious.<br><br>"Ah, no..."<br><br>Raon shook his head with an awkward laugh.<br><br>'To openly offer them here of all places...'<br><br>To discuss illegal transfers in front of so many people - Alice really wasn't right in the head.<br><br>"Tablets that have already been received cannot be transferred to others. You should know that?"<br><br>Glenn frowned as he looked down at Alice.<br><br>"It was a joke, a joke!"<br><br>Alice waved her hands dismissively and stepped back.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Glenn briefly clicked his tongue and turned his attention back to the executives.<br><br>"I'll say it again. We will select successor candidates after calculating performance based on the types and numbers of tablets you've received."<br><br>He nodded, indicating that only those with many tablets would be able to pass the test.<br><br>'Hmm...'<br><br>Raon clicked his tongue briefly while looking at Glenn.<br><br>-Why are you doing that?<br><br>Wrath lowered his gaze.<br><br>-There's hardly anyone with more Golden Tablets than you, no?<br><br>He tilted his head as if wondering why Raon was worried.<br><br>'My conscience is bothering me.'<br><br>Raon let out a short sigh.<br><br>-Your conscience is bothering you? What do you mean?<br><br>'Grandfather has given me special treatment. I feel like I might have received more tablets than others for the same achievements.'<br><br>He hadn't realized it before, but now he knew for certain. Glenn showed a bit of favoritism toward him compared to others. His heart tightened at the thought that Bronze Tablet achievements might have been upgraded to Silver, and Silver to Gold.<br><br>-What absolute nonsense you're spouting!<br><br>Wrath growled like a dog.<br><br>'What?'<br><br>-Though your old man is a pervert who eats Nadine bread every day and watches you sleep for 12 hours when you're unconscious, he's never been negligent in his role as leader!<br><br>He swung his fist as if telling Raon to come to his senses.<br><br>-It's true that the old man values you more than the other children.<br><br>Wrath tapped his forehead as if telling Raon to think about it.<br><br>-But he's not someone who would compromise fairness by tampering with tablet grades. If anything, he might have gone easy on your martial arts training - you can't argue with that!<br><br>He added that Glenn valued the family more than what met the eye, nodding his chin slightly.<br><br>'Now that I think about it...'<br><br>Raon clicked his tongue briefly while looking at the platform.<br><br>'You might be right.'<br><br>As Wrath said, Glenn might have given him other rewards or taught him swordsmanship, but he probably never upgraded tablet grades. <br><br>'Grandfather truly values Zieghart above all else.'<br><br>Raon found himself smiling unconsciously as he felt Glenn's genuine love for Zieghart.<br><br>"So will the decision be based solely on our achievements up until now?"<br><br>Serena, the Void Sword Division Leader, stepped forward and raised her hand.<br><br>"Isn't that right?"<br><br>Trevin nodded slightly.<br><br>"What else would we look at if not what we've accumulated so far?"<br><br>He dusted his hands as if it were obvious.<br><br>"I'm against it. Since the successor selection is starting now, I think we should start from now. That would be fair!"<br><br>Martha clenched her fist, saying they should compete for Golden Tablets starting from today.<br><br>"But that would be unfair to those who've already accumulated tablets."<br><br>Burren shook his head, saying that would be unreasonable.<br><br>"Of course, making a decision based solely on past achievements is a bit disappointing too."<br><br>He lowered his eyebrows, saying he understood Martha's point. He seemed unsure which approach was right.<br><br>"Yaaawn..."<br><br>Runaan yawned widely, showing no interest in the position of Head of House.<br><br>"Ru-Runaan!"<br><br>Her father, Rokan Sullion, waved his hand at her to close her mouth while conscious of others around them.<br><br>"I have a question!"<br><br>Darkan now shouted more formally that he had another question.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Glenn ignored Darkan again, and now even the executives wouldn't look at him. They seemed to be treating him as if he didn't exist.<br><br>"The achievements I speak of are the accomplishments built up by individuals."<br><br>Glenn calmly lowered his chin.<br><br>"When evaluating achievements created directly by swordsmen, we cannot ignore past accomplishments."<br><br>He lowered his gaze calmly, stating it was natural to consider the number of tablets collected in the past.<br><br>"However, it's also true that the period starting from when we announced the successor selection is more important. Therefore..."<br><br>Glenn opened his palm again and brought out the Golden, Silver, and Bronze Tablets.<br><br>"Past Bronze Tablets will be worth 1 point, Silver Tablets 2 points, and Golden Tablets 3 points, while tablets received from now on will be worth double these points."<br><br>He nodded, indicating he would accept both the opinion to only count past achievements and the opinion to start from now.<br><br>"Exactly five. We will select five successor candidates based on performance."<br><br>Glenn spread his palm wide, stating he would select only five people in the first test.<br><br>"Five? Well, if it's that many..."<br><br>"Yeah. Not bad."<br><br>"It's worth trying for."<br><br>The senior executives clicked their tongues as if thinking it was worth attempting.<br><br>"But aren't there hardly any important missions these days?"<br><br>Balder raised his hand.<br><br>"The Five Demons... no, the Three Demons are hiding in darkness, and most people are living peacefully, even if temporarily. There's really not much to do."<br><br>He shook his head, saying it would be difficult to find missions worthy of Golden Tablets.<br><br>"Finding missions and what you achieve from them is also a skill. There are no unimportant missions in this world."<br><br>Glenn lowered his fingertips with an arrogant bearing, indicating they would have to handle everything themselves from now on.<br><br>"So we have to manage everything from start to finish."<br><br>"Well, he's right. It's our own business, so we should take care of it ourselves."<br><br>"I'm fine with that too. However..."<br><br>The executives' gazes all turned toward the pillar where the Palace Masters stood.<br><br>"How can we compete with those two?"<br><br>"Master Karoon has been a Palace Master for a long time, so that's one thing, but the Light Wind Palace Master is really..."<br><br>"His achievements are unbelievable. At that age, no one except the Central Martial Palace Master can compete with him."<br><br>The swordsmen sighed, deciding they would have to proceed while considering Karoon and Raon to be in a different league.<br><br>"Then you may go."<br><br>Glenn waved his hand dismissively, as if he had said everything he needed to say today.<br><br>"He said five people, right? How will it turn out?"<br><br>"If we exclude Master Karoon and Master Raon, there are exactly three spots left."<br><br>"Will Lady Alice participate too?"<br><br>"Judging by how she offered to give away her tablets earlier, she doesn't seem interested."<br><br>"But her eyes are sparkling too much to say that's true."<br><br>The executives split into small groups to discuss the successor selection.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Among the swordsmen leaving the audience chamber, Raon's eyes met with Karoon's.<br><br>"The real test will start from the second one. Prepare thoroughly."<br><br>Karoon's eyes flashed coldly, as if telling Raon not to fail no matter what.<br><br>"Why are you concerned about me?"<br><br>Raon tilted his chin while maintaining eye contact with Karoon.<br><br>"Because it means nothing without you. I will climb the proper steps to reach that throne."<br><br>Karoon looked at the throne with calm eyes, showing no trace of jealousy or envy.<br><br>"I understand. I'll fulfill that wish."<br><br>Raon bowed to Karoon, saying they would meet again. Thud. Raon and Karoon left the audience chamber simultaneously. Whoosh. Though their gaits and postures were equally straight and elegant, their eyes held starkly different expressions. Glenn watched the backs of Raon and Karoon, so similar yet so different.<br><br>'What choices will you make from here?'<br><br>As he smiled with anticipation, a sound that shook the audience chamber's ceiling was heard.<br><br>"I said I have a question, you bastard!"<br><br>***<br><br>As soon as Karoon returned to the Central Martial Palace, he summoned all the executives.<br><br>"You must have heard that the Head of House is selecting a successor."<br><br>"Yes!"<br><br>The Central Martial Palace executives responded without hesitation. They seemed to already know everything about the successor candidate selection.<br><br>"From now on, bring all important missions coming from the Shadow Agents, and send people outside to report all unusual occurrences."<br><br>Karoon showed his intention to not only monopolize important missions but also participate in external affairs.<br><br>"Don't miss a single one, and bring them to me first."<br><br>"We receive your command!"<br><br>The Central Martial Palace executives simply bowed their heads, as if not even thinking about it.<br><br>"Ah, Father..."<br><br>Burren cautiously raised his hand.<br><br>"Even without monopolizing important missions, wouldn't you easily make it into the top five, Father?"<br><br>Karoon had not used a single Golden Tablet, keeping all of them. Having lived as a Palace Master for so long, he surely had more than Raon.<br><br>"This test isn't just a checkpoint, but a crucial gateway to determining the Head of House. We must show overwhelming prowess, not just cross the line."<br><br>Karoon clenched his fist on the desk. His determination to become Head of House spread, making the office vibrate as if it would explode.<br><br>"I thought that would mean less favoritism for the first place...."<br><br>"No."<br><br>Karoon firmly shook his head.<br><br>"Even without special benefits, taking first place is right. That's what I think the Head of Zieghart should be."<br><br>His red eyes blazed with passion as if teaching his son even in this moment.<br><br>"We will follow you, Palace Master!"<br><br>The Central Martial Palace executives bowed their heads with pressed lips, seemingly moved by Karoon's demeanor.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>Burren also swallowed hard, admiring Karoon's unwavering spirit.<br><br>'Father is serious. He intends to defeat Raon and become Head of House no matter what.'<br><br>Despite knowing he lagged behind Raon in important achievements and martial prowess, Karoon had no intention of giving up on becoming Head of House. He was clearly determined to chase after it by any means necessary. Strangely, this didn't appear ugly at all. Rather, it made him seem even more admirable than before, enough to make one want to follow him.<br><br>'Raon...'<br><br>Burren curled his lips slightly as he thought of Raon in the annex building.<br><br>'What do you plan to do?'<br><br>***<br><br>"Head of House! Such a dreamlike title! Let's definitely go for it!"<br><br>Edgar exclaimed enthusiastically while grabbing Raon's shoulders.<br><br>"You must get first place no matter what!"<br><br>He nodded vigorously, telling Raon to surpass Karoon and pass the first test with the highest performance.<br><br>"Stop it! Raon will handle it himself!"<br><br>Sylvia slapped Edgar's back with her palm.<br><br>"Ignore that man, and do as you wish."<br><br>She embraced Raon with a gentle smile.<br><br>"I-If you're going to do it anyway, aim for first..."<br><br>Edgar raised trembling eyes while rubbing his struck back.<br><br>"Raon. They say being first isn't always the best."<br><br>Sia waved her hand up and down as if telling him to take it slow, saying she heard it from grandfather.<br><br>"Still, I hope you get first place."<br><br>She grinned, clearly hoping her younger brother would take first place.<br><br>"Unfortunately, that will be difficult."<br><br>Raon shook his head at Sia.<br><br>"Sir Karoon and I have lived different lengths of time as Palace Masters. No matter how hard I try, it's difficult to overcome the power of time."<br><br>He scratched his cheek as he said it would be difficult to collect more Golden Tablets than Karoon.<br><br>"Since they're selecting five people anyway, we just need to be among them. Don't worry too much."<br><br>Glenn said performance was only the first test. Even if there were benefits for first place, it wouldn't be insurmountable, so there was no absolute need to catch up to Karoon.<br><br>'However...'<br><br>He would need to maintain his position. Since someone might catch up from behind, he needed to achieve a certain level of performance.<br><br>"I prefer first place too! I don't want it written in Raon Zieghart's biography that he started in second place!"<br><br>Encia raised her finger as if asking him to take first place.<br><br>"What do you think, Yua?"<br><br>She called forward Yua, who had brought tea, and embraced her.<br><br>"I just want Young Master to do as he wishes."<br><br>Yua grinned as if she would be happy with whatever Raon did.<br><br>"We shouldn't ask Raon's follower."<br><br>Edgar shook his head, saying they wouldn't get an answer from Yua.<br><br>"Yua likes whatever Raon does anyway."<br><br>"Because he's my benefactor."<br><br>Yua smiled as if she didn't mind Edgar's nagging.<br><br>"Then I'll be going."<br><br>"Yua."<br><br>Raon stopped Yua as she was about to return to the kitchen.<br><br>"How long has it been since you visited Habun Castle?"<br><br>"Me? Um..."<br><br>Yua put her finger to her lips before looking at Raon.<br><br>"It's been a little over a year. I've been too busy lately to go, but I'm planning to visit this time."<br><br>She smiled, saying she would take leave to visit her grandfather.<br><br>"You'll let me take leave, right?"<br><br>Yua clasped her hands together pleadingly.<br><br>"Of course! Go ahead!"<br><br>Sylvia nodded in Raon's place, telling her to go.<br><br>"Don't think about here, just enjoy yourself!"<br><br>Edgar waved his hand with a smile, seeming to have forgotten about the Head of House matter in this brief moment.<br><br>"Sh-Should I go with you?"<br><br>Julius approached Yua while glancing around furtively.<br><br>"No."<br><br>Raon firmly raised his hand.<br><br>"Because she's going with me."<br><br>He smiled confidently as he placed his hand on Yua's shoulder.<br><br>"Eh!"<br><br>"You're going to Habun Castle?"<br><br>"At such a crucial time?"<br><br>The people in the annex building widened their eyes in surprise, as if they couldn't have imagined he would accompany Yua to Habun Castle.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Raon nodded with a smile.<br><br>"It might not help much with the succession competition, but there's someone there I'll definitely need in the future."<br><br>He clicked his tongue as he thought of the Demon King of Sloth who slept hidden across from Habun Castle.<br><br>"This time..."<br><br>"Then!"<br><br>Suddenly, a magic circle appeared on the ceiling, and Evelyn jumped out.<br><br>"I want to go too!"<br><br>Evelyn's eyes began burning deep and hot like the heat within a bonfire.<br><br>"Ab-so-lu-te-ly!"</p>
