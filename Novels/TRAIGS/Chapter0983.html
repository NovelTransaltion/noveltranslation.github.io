        <p>"The feeling of cutting through a breath attack isn't bad at all."<br><br>Raon nodded with satisfaction as he watched the frost fragments scatter in the sky.<br><br>[Grrrr...]<br><br>Dsiouros's pupils trembled with shock, as if he never imagined his breath could be frozen and shattered.<br><br>'As expected...'<br><br>Raon smiled faintly as he observed Dsiouros's startled eyes.<br><br>'Dsiouros is weaker than Kaivar.'<br><br>Although Dsiouros's flame breath had enough power to erase this entire area, it wasn't strong enough to penetrate his sword. Just as there were differences in power among Transcendents, it seemed that dragons also varied in strength depending on how long they had lived.<br><br>-Opening your Sword Domain and using full power, yet you're still showing off!<br><br>Wrath frowned, telling him not to be arrogant.<br><br>'Of course I had to use full power.'<br><br>Raon tilted his Divine Sword and looked at the hostages behind him.<br><br>'If I had blocked it halfheartedly, the people behind me could have been hurt.'<br><br>He probably could have cut through Dsiouros's flame breath without using full power, but he had used it from the start to protect the hostages from the heat. By unleashing a sword strike that harmonized frost and wrath, he was able to completely freeze and shatter the flame breath.<br><br>-Well, freezing flames is the best way to deal with them!<br><br>Wrath nodded, seemingly satisfied that his cold energy had frozen the dragon's breath.<br><br>-That lizard's expression is priceless! Its liver looks just right.<br><br>He licked his lips, saying the shocked Dsiouros looked delicious. He was truly insane.<br><br>"Am I... am I still alive?"<br><br>"To think he could cut through a breath attack..."<br><br>"Is this even possible?"<br><br>"No way, how can a human slice through flames!"<br><br>The people behind him stared blankly at the frost-filled sky, unable to believe they were still alive.<br><br>"It wasn't an ordinary sword aura..."<br><br>"A Transcendent. And one who has properly honed their sword skills."<br><br>"How can someone so young possess transcendent sword aura..."<br><br>The dwarves' eyes sparkled, seemingly captivated by Raon's swordsmanship that had perfectly split the flame breath. It was no wonder they were called the race of iron and fire, reacting like this even in such a situation.<br><br>"Didn't I tell you!"<br><br>Latiru excitedly waved his hands, which were covered in burns.<br><br>"There's no way Borgos would let them go just like that!"<br><br>He nodded confidently, saying he had believed without a doubt.<br><br>"That's truly insane..."<br><br>Martha let out a hollow laugh, as if dumbfounded.<br><br>"Not only did he cut through the breath, but he froze it and then shattered it. Is that even possible?"<br><br>She shook her head, saying that despite having watched Raon for a long time, she never knew he could freeze and shatter a breath attack.<br><br>"He must have taken measures to prevent the hostages from being harmed by the heat."<br><br>Burren nodded, saying he understood Raon's intention in freezing the breath.<br><br>"Of course, the power that made it possible is still astounding..."<br><br>He let out a sigh, saying it was a level of power beyond comprehension.<br><br>"Frost... good..."<br><br>Runaan raised both hands with her cheeks flushed red, seemingly pleased by the blue cold energy filling the surroundings.<br><br>"Seeing the Palace Master's sword gives me courage."<br><br>"Yeah. If the Palace Master can block the flame breath, we should be able to fight."<br><br>"Let's go all out today."<br><br>"We'll become dragon slayers right here."<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen seemed to gain courage from Raon's sword and steeled their resolve to fight Dsiouros. A green wind swirled around the Light Wind Sword Formation as the swordsmen's spirits soared to the sky.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>[This... this is impossible...]<br><br>The winged dragon Dsiouros swallowed hard as he looked at his flame breath that had turned to ice shards and shattered. His massive body trembled, and the fire-attribute mana that had been condensing around him dispersed like mist.<br><br>[It's impossible!]<br><br>He had anticipated that his breath might be blocked due to the strange sensation he felt from the golden-haired, red-eyed human. But he never imagined it would be not just blocked, but completely cut through, with the heat more intense than lava trapped in ice and shattered.<br><br>In the thousands of years he had lived, this was his first such bewildering experience. His mind went blank, and his heart raced as if it would burst.<br><br>'Dangerous. That human is dangerous.'<br><br>The golden-haired, red-eyed human had shattered his breath using only his innate power, without using any special abilities. This meant he had the ability to cut off his head at any moment.<br><br>'Wait a minute...'<br><br>Golden hair and red eyes? He remembered that when the Lord had visited recently and told him to prepare for war with humans, he had warned him to be careful of a golden-haired, red-eyed swordsman.<br><br>'He definitely said it was an old man...'<br><br>The Lord had said it was an elderly man who could die any day, so he hadn't paid much attention, but he never expected this outcome. It seemed all golden-haired, red-eyed humans were threatening.<br><br>'It would be best to retreat from here.'<br><br>The Lord's words were concerning, and he couldn't predict the power possessed by that golden-haired, red-eyed human, so getting away from this place was the priority.<br><br>[Don't get cocky just because you blocked a flame breath!]<br><br>Dsiouros forcibly gathered the dispersing mana.<br><br>[I have magic beyond breath attacks!]<br><br>He chanted dragon language and unleashed crimson lightning towards the ground. It was a transcendent magic, Heaven's Wrath. Amidst the violently pouring lightning bolts, Dsiouros turned his body.<br><br>'It's not perfect, but it should buy me some time.'<br><br>Magic usually doesn't exert its full power when one's mental state is shaken, but since he was only trying to buy time rather than kill them, his current state was sufficient.<br><br>'First, I'll fly higher and then use spatial movement...'<br><br>Just as Dsiouros spread his wings to fly higher, a sword silently rose, creating a red flash as it rushed towards his neck.<br><br>[Block it!]<br><br>Dsiouros hurriedly chanted dragon language, but the blade imbued with golden flames pierced through the thick defense of dragon language and severed both of his wings. With a chilling sound of tearing space, the red wings that had stretched out to cover the sky fell, replaced by bright red blood.<br><br>Dsiouros, unable to regain his senses due to the pain of his severed wings and incapable of using flight magic, plummeted onto the frozen blue desert. Waves of sand scattered in all directions due to his unimaginable weight.<br><br>[Urgh...]<br><br>Dsiouros opened his eyes, letting out a painful groan.<br><br>[Hu... human...]<br><br>The golden-haired, red-eyed human stood before him with a calm demeanor. To cut through his defenses and sever both wings with a sword strike he couldn't even perceive—it was an impossible level of power. Honestly, it was enough to instill fear.<br><br>"That's right. You should run away like the lizard you are."<br><br>Raon looked down at Dsiouros and tilted his chin.<br><br>"However, I've experienced too much of your kind's malice to let you escape."<br><br>Despite their boasts of being the strongest race on earth and mediators of the world, dragons were no different from lizards that cut off their tails and ran away when in danger.<br><br>"You have only two ways to leave this place."<br><br>Raon raised his finger and pointed at the Light Wind Palace swordsmen.<br><br>"Either kill them or be killed by them."<br><br>After warning Dsiouros, he turned to look at the Light Wind Palace swordsmen.<br><br>"The same goes for you. Fight and win."<br><br>Raon said he wouldn't intervene further and stepped back.<br><br>[Does that mean...]<br><br>Dsiouros slowly raised his body.<br><br>[If I kill those humans, you'll let me go?]<br><br>"You catch on quick."<br><br>Raon smiled as he looked into Dsiouros's burning red eyes.<br><br>"Just don't use your breath, and don't think about running away in the middle."<br><br>He nodded, saying he would promise if those conditions were met.<br><br>[Very well...]<br><br>Dsiouros gritted his teeth, blood dripping, as he stood his massive body upright. He looked down at the Light Wind Palace swordsmen and unleashed a chilling killing intent.<br><br>[Don't regret this!]<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>"That crazy bastard is selling us out in the end."<br><br>Martha let out a hollow laugh, as if in disbelief.<br><br>"It means he believes in us. Let's take it positively."<br><br>Burren nodded, saying this must be Raon's test.<br><br>"We can do it..."<br><br>Runaan blinked her eyes, saying they could definitely do it, just like when they started this mission.<br><br>"You're unusually confident today? Did you eat something weird?"<br><br>Martha lowered her eyebrows, looking puzzled.<br><br>"Because we can do it."<br><br>Runaan clenched her fist, not just steeling her resolve but seeming to be certain of victory. It felt as if she was seeing something.<br><br>"A-Alright! Let's do this!"<br><br>Krein raised his sword, shouting that they should fight to the death.<br><br>"Uhuhuhu..."<br><br>Dorian also gripped his sword with both hands, shedding tears.<br><br>"I'm glad I joined the Light Wind Palace. To think I'd face a life-or-death battle with an ancient dragon."<br><br>Trevin licked his lips, saying it was a great opportunity for growth.<br><br>"That's the best part about the Light Wind Palace."<br><br>Mark Goetun bowed his head, welcoming them once again to the Light Wind Palace.<br><br>[You have no chances left!]<br><br>Dsiouros furrowed his brow and lowered his blood-dripping claw. Flames rose from his palm and unfurled like silk, falling towards the Light Wind Palace members' heads.<br><br>"It's too late to dodge! Focus on defense!"<br><br>At Burren's shout, the Light Wind Palace swordsmen moved to the inside of the sword formation and compressed their aura. The aura blooming from their swords became a blue-tinged shield that collided with the flames Dsiouros had unleashed. Violent shockwaves erupted one after another as the flames and aura met, creating purple sparks.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he watched the fierce competition between the flames and aura.<br><br>'They're not inferior in power.'<br><br>The power of Dsiouros's 9th circle magic and the swordsmen enhanced by the sword formation were almost equal. This meant that if Dsiouros didn't use transcendent-level magic and flame breath, they wouldn't be at a disadvantage.<br><br>'Assuming he can't use his breath, they just need to block the transcendent-level magic somehow.'<br><br>To block that... Raon turned his gaze towards the Light Wind Palace, thinking of an answer to defeat Dsiouros.<br><br>"We can't give him time!"<br><br>Burren wrinkled his nose and stomped his foot.<br><br>"Go in right now!"<br><br>He moved to the center of the sword formation, saying they needed to press on without giving him a chance to breathe.<br><br>"I know!"<br><br>Martha, the Light Wind Palace's charge leader, rushed forward before Burren could finish his instructions. She thrust her sword towards Dsiouros's body, disregarding defense as if prepared to die. Her sword, imbued with heaviness, pierced through Dsiouros's scales and cut deeply into his flesh.<br><br>[You, you wretch!]<br><br>Dsiouros narrowed his eyes and unleashed sharp flame blades towards Martha. Just before Martha's body was about to be skewered, a wall of frost rose up and blocked Dsiouros's flames.<br><br>"Saved you..."<br><br>It was Runaan. She tilted her chin calmly, as if she had known this would happen.<br><br>"I'm not thanking you!"<br><br>Martha rushed forward again to cut Dsiouros's scales, as if she had believed Runaan would come to her aid.<br><br>"Didn't expect you to..."<br><br>Runaan followed closely behind Martha, erasing all the falling flames. The two worked together in perfect offense and defense, unlike when they fought like enemies.<br><br>[Kuaaaah!]<br><br>Dsiouros let out a pain-filled scream and spewed out blue-burning flames.<br><br>"Fall back..."<br><br>Realizing she couldn't block this magic alone, Runaan grabbed Martha's nape and retreated together.<br><br>"Destructive Sword Form!"<br><br>As soon as Martha and Runaan returned, Burren concentrated the sword formation's energy and split the blue flames pouring down like a waterfall.<br><br>[You insects!]<br><br>Dsiouros, seemingly truly enraged, unleashed dragon language magic and 9th circle magic in succession. He seemed to be trying to buy time by forcing them to retreat somehow.<br><br>"We can block it! Move forward!"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen, realizing they couldn't give Dsiouros time, advanced while cutting through the magic. The clash between swords and magic, dragon and swordsmen, continued endlessly. Dsiouros screamed as his scales were cut by sword aura, while the swordsmen groaned as they swung their swords with their skin scorched by the heat.<br><br>The fierce battle between Dsiouros and the Light Wind Palace swordsmen continued. Amidst the relentless exchange, the first to lose patience was the supposedly strongest race on earth.<br><br>[I'll, I'll kill you all!]<br><br>Dsiouros summoned deep crimson flames, almost dark, in front of his chest, roaring in anger. The heat emanating from the somber flames was enough to distort the surroundings.<br><br>"Black flames..."<br><br>"Is, is it transcendent-level magic?"<br><br>"Don't tell me it's hell's..."<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen swallowed hard at the heat radiating from the black flames.<br><br>"It's a bluff!"<br><br>Burren raised his head, shouting no less fiercely than Dsiouros.<br><br>"Even an ancient dragon needs preparation time to use transcendent-level magic!"<br><br>He raised his sword, saying they needed to keep pressing on.<br><br>"That's right. How could someone with a broken spirit use transcendent-level magic right away! Follow me!"<br><br>Martha rushed forward even faster, thrusting her sword into Dsiouros as if unafraid of the black flames.<br><br>"We have the advantage..."<br><br>Runaan, also realizing this was their chance, cut off Dsiouros's ankle with her sword blooming with frost flowers.<br><br>"Let's go!"<br><br>"Stab him!"<br><br>"Da-damn it!"<br><br>Following Mark Goetun's instructions, Krein and Dorian took the lead and thrust their sword aura. Dozens of sword aura streams shot by the Light Wind Palace swordsmen sliced through Dsiouros's body. Blood poured from his body like a broken dam.<br><br>[You flies!]<br><br>Unable to endure, Dsiouros struck down with his incomplete transcendent-level magic.<br><br>"Not so fast!"<br><br>As if he had been waiting for this, Trevin drew all the power of the sword formation and deflected the black flames Dsiouros had shot towards the desert behind them. Despite being incomplete, the transcendent-level magic spread across the entire desert behind them, melting the sand itself.<br><br>'Not bad.'<br><br>Raon licked his lips as he watched the Light Wind Palace swordsmen drive Dsiouros into a corner.<br><br>'Good strategy not giving him time, and good patience too.'<br><br>The only way for the Light Wind Palace to win was to steal Dsiouros's time, and the swordsmen had perfectly executed the plan, sticking to him like leeches.<br><br>'They've all grown.'<br><br>Burren had become calm enough to live up to his name as Vice Palace Master, Martha's courage and charge were unparalleled on the continent, and Runaan coordinated the sword formation with a broader perspective to ensure no one suffered severe injuries.<br><br>Dorian, despite shedding tears, stood at the front blocking Dsiouros's magic, and Krein trusted Dorian and advanced to thrust his sword.<br><br>Mark Goetun, Trevin, and the other swordsmen also seemed to have grown through this battle, perfectly fulfilling their roles.<br><br>-They've all grown up well...<br><br>Wrath sniffled, as if proud of the swordsmen.<br><br>'Yes. They're worth watching now.'<br><br>Raon nodded in agreement.<br><br>[Kuaaaah!]<br><br>Dsiouros shook his body, screaming. Due to the many sword wounds, blood rained down around him.<br><br>[I don't care anymore! I'll kill you all!]<br><br>He seemed to have forgotten his promise, as he rolled his eyes and opened his massive maw. Inside Dsiouros's throat, lava-like flames began to condense in a circular motion.<br><br>'Flame breath.'<br><br>It seemed he had given up on transcendent-level magic due to his inability to concentrate and was trying to unleash his breath attack.<br><br>-What are you doing!<br><br>Wrath waved his hands quickly.<br><br>-Hurry and stop it! The kids will die!<br><br>'Wait.'<br><br>Raon stopped the flailing Wrath and looked at the Light Wind Palace swordsmen.<br><br>'Those guys, they're going to try.'<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen didn't wait for him but strengthened their sword formation and raised their swords as if they were going to fight directly. Their eyes blazed with the desire to fight to the end.<br><br>'Alright. Give it a try.'<br><br>If it was the same flame breath as before, even the Light Wind Palace would be annihilated, but in his current state, Dsiouros could barely use his breath properly. If the Light Wind Palace swordsmen steeled their resolve and focused on the sword formation, they might be able to block it.<br><br>Dsiouros, unable to fully draw out his flame breath due to pain and urgency, condensed only about half before unleashing it towards the Light Wind Palace swordsmen.<br><br>"Light Wind Sword Storm!"<br><br>At Burren's shout, the Light Wind Palace swordsmen simultaneously swung their swords. Various sword auras merged into one, creating an intense blue light.<br><br>The flame breath and the Light Wind Sword Formation's ultimate technique collided, causing tremendous shockwaves to explode in all directions. Sand crumbled, and the black flames burning behind them were extinguished.<br><br>However, the Light Wind Palace swordsmen's expressions hardened, and cold sweat began to pour from their foreheads as they seemed to be losing in terms of power.<br><br>[It's over!]<br><br>Dsiouros, seemingly no longer caring about the consequences, roared and unleashed an even more intense flame breath.<br><br>"Endure it!"<br><br>"Believe in the path we've walked, being beaten by Raon!"<br><br>"We can cut it too..."<br><br>At the cries of Burren, Martha, and Runaan, the Light Wind Palace swordsmen stepped forward, drawing out their last strength. As the swordsmen's minds and hearts connected like a single sword, a familiar green wind blew in, forging everyone's energy into one blade. The Light Wind Sword Formation's true ultimate technique. Light Wind Sword Storm.<br><br>The true ultimate technique of the Light Wind Sword Formation, created by Rimmer and Raon, was unleashed with the green wind, cutting through Dsiouros's flame breath and deeply slashing his neck.<br><br>[Urgh...]<br><br>Dsiouros couldn't even scream like before, his whole body just trembling. The dragon's reverse scale. Normally, he should have struggled desperately, but he didn't have much strength left.<br><br>"Now's the time!"<br><br>"Advance!"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen, despite being covered in bright red burns from the breath attack, didn't retreat but thrust their blue blades into Dsiouros. Astral rings and sword aura rained down, cutting through the dragon's thick scales and tearing apart his flesh and bones.<br><br>Realizing he had no chance of winning, Dsiouros gathered his remaining strength to prepare a teleportation spell.<br><br>[Tele... port...]<br><br>Just as he was about to use dragon language magic to move through space, a heavy and cold blade pierced into his mouth.<br><br>[Kuhuhup!]<br><br>Dsiouros let out a scream that seemed to tear his mouth apart as his dragon language magic was interrupted.<br><br>"Where do you think you're going."<br><br>"We can see through you."<br><br>Martha and Runaan twisted the blades that had pierced Dsiouros's mouth, saying they had anticipated this after watching Raon.<br><br>"Now, kill him!"<br><br>As the Light Wind Palace swordsmen were about to deliver the final blow at Burren's shout...<br><br>"That's enough."<br><br>Raon stepped forward and raised his hand. The Light Wind Palace swordsmen immediately erased their killing intent and returned to their original posture, standing straight as soon as Raon stepped forward. It was a display of complete trust in him.<br><br>"It wasn't a bad fight."<br><br>Raon nodded to the Light Wind Palace, saying it was a decent battle.<br><br>"Haah..."<br><br>"It's over."<br><br>Martha and Burren sat down on the spot, lowering their swords as soon as Raon finished speaking.<br><br>"I told you we'd win..."<br><br>Runaan bowed her head calmly, as if she had foreseen this outcome.<br><br>"I, I fought because I was more afraid of the Palace Master..."<br><br>Dorian's lips trembled as he said Raon was scarier than the dragon.<br><br>"That's true."<br><br>Krein nodded, saying he understood what Dorian meant.<br><br>"To think we really killed a dragon."<br><br>"And not just any dragon, but an ancient one!"<br><br>"I never thought I'd stand in front of a breath attack and live."<br><br>"This is what the Light Wind Palace is all about!"<br><br>"The Palace Master even praised us, so we must have fought well!"<br><br>The swordsmen raised their swords and cheered, seemingly excited by their victory.<br><br>"However!"<br><br>Raon shook his head as he looked at the rejoicing swordsmen.<br><br>"There were many unnecessary movements. If you had properly utilized your strength, you could have caught this lizard without even seeing its breath."<br><br>He clicked his tongue, saying there were many disappointing aspects as well.<br><br>"Plus, there was that initial mistake. Well, let's talk about it slowly when we get back."<br><br>Raon waved his hand, saying they should have a proper debriefing when they return to Zieghart.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>"Tell us later..."<br><br>"That's right! It's scary to hear it before we can even feel the joy of victory!"<br><br>"I'm already worried..."<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen shook their heads, saying Raon had no human emotions.<br><br>-What a ruthless guy...<br><br>Wrath also muttered that Raon was too much, letting out a sigh.<br><br>"Dsiouros."<br><br>Raon ignored the complaints of the Light Wind Palace behind him and stepped on Dsiouros's head, who was coughing up blood.<br><br>"You broke your promise not to use your breath, and you also broke your promise not to run away, right?"<br><br>He curled his lips as he looked into the dragon's red eyes, which were larger than his own body.<br><br>"Then I suppose I can do as I please too?"<br><br>[Urgh...]<br><br>"Look forward to it."<br><br>Dsiouros's massive body, reflected in Raon's red eyes, trembled like a mosquito's wings.<br><br>"I'll make you spill everything you know, and even what you don't know."</p>
