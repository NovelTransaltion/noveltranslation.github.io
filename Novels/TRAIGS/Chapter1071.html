        <p>-This damn god won't listen to his believer! Is he really dead or something?<br><br>Wrath glared at the message with unabating anger as he cursed at the demon god.<br><br>'That's a bit too harsh...'<br><br>Hopefully he won't actually receive divine punishment? Raon shook his head and checked the message that appeared before his eyes.<br><br>[You have achieved a historic accomplishment.]<br><br>[All abilities increase by 100 points.]<br><br>The first thing shown was, naturally, a message about ability increases.<br><br>'Ability growth doesn't mean much anymore.'<br><br>His current physical abilities had reached the pinnacle even among Transcendents. He had surpassed human limits to reach a level comparable to Angels or Demons, so ability increases held little appeal.<br><br>'However, 100 points is different.'<br><br>With a 100-point increase all at once, he could feel a clear difference even in his body that had reached its limits.<br><br>A surge of joy swept through his body at this growth, reminiscent of when he had absorbed Wrath's power during his trainee days.<br><br>-Even when I feed you power, you still act like this!<br><br>Wrath furrowed his brow in displeasure.<br><br>-You're in an ambiguous stage right now, but once you break through that realm, you'll encounter a new world.<br><br>He shook his head, indicating that the body's true limits hadn't been reached yet.<br><br>-Train so that it's not the mind controlling the body, but the body controlling itself.<br><br>Wrath poked his forehead, warning him not to neglect physical training and ability growth.<br><br>'So you're saying you'll keep giving me ability points until then?'<br><br>Raon smiled and tilted his head.<br><br>'Thanks. You really are the giving tree.'<br><br>-Huh? Uh...<br><br>Wrath blinked blankly before jumping up in shock.<br><br>-Absolutely not! I won't give you anything ever again!<br><br>He waved his hands frantically, telling Raon to stop talking nonsense.<br><br>'You're always so entertaining.'<br><br>Raon chuckled and checked the next message.<br><br>[New trait has been created.]<br><br>The second thing he noticed was the new trait.<br><br>'What's this?'<br><br>With rising anticipation, he checked the details of the new trait. reduces bleeding when wounded and accelerates blood generation. After confirming the trait's effects, Raon snapped his fingers.<br><br>'This is pretty good.'<br><br>With this trait, even if he received serious wounds during battle, he could reduce blood loss and fight longer than before. It was a perfect trait for him.<br><br>-Ugh...<br><br>Wrath's eyes trembled as he looked at . He seemed to dislike everything about it.<br><br>[Trait rank has increased.]<br><br>[Trait rank has increased.]<br><br>[Trait rank has increased by two levels.]<br><br>[Trait rank has increased.]<br><br>[Trait rank has increased.]<br><br>[Trait rank has increased.]<br><br>[Trait rank has increased.]<br><br>[Trait rank has increased.]<br><br>[Trait rank has increased.]<br><br>[Trait rank has increased.]<br><br>[Trait rank has increased.]<br><br>[Trait rank has increased.]<br><br>-W-why are there so many!<br><br>Wrath gritted his teeth, claiming that just looking at all these trait increases was making his neck hurt.<br><br>'Even I have to admit it's a lot.'<br><br>It seemed many traits had increased in rank because the battle had been long and every situation had been urgent and dangerous. However, the most important information hadn't appeared yet.<br><br>[You have received the sincere gratitude of the spirit souls.]<br><br>[Trait evolves into trait .]<br><br>The spirit souls of the Blade of Requiem left him a great gift as they departed this world. Now he could use Soul Sword without the blade's help.<br><br>'Though I'll need to work harder, of course.'<br><br>Since Soul Sword's rank had returned to 1-star, its power had weakened and controlling it wouldn't be easy.<br><br>But since he had walked this path before, returning to that level shouldn't be too difficult.<br><br>-That's a good mindset.<br><br>Wrath suddenly struck a pompous pose and lifted his chin.<br><br>-A King should not dwell on what was lost, but think about how to develop what he has now!<br><br>He patted Raon's shoulder, telling him to remember this.<br><br>'Yeah...'<br><br>In the past, he would have dismissed it with "But I'm not a King," but it seemed his personality and way of thinking had changed significantly.<br><br>'Finally.'<br><br>-More? There's more?<br><br>Wrath flopped around like a freshly caught fish, saying he was going crazy.<br><br>'This is the last one.'<br><br>[New title has been created.]<br><br>'Soul Slayer?'<br><br>Looking at the title's name, it seemed to be a trait gained from killing the Leader of the White Blood Religion with Soul Sword. However, he felt uncomfortable receiving this title since he had only launched the Soul Sword attack while Rimmer and the spirit souls had done the rest.<br><br>-What nonsense are you spouting now!<br><br>Wrath deeply wrinkled his nose bridge.<br><br>-If you're going to think like that, then spit out everything you've consumed until now!<br><br>The creature growled, claiming that he had never received a fair reward.<br><br>'That's true.'<br><br>Raon smiled faintly and nodded. It seemed Wrath was trying to encourage him in his own way. Taking courage from his words, he checked the title's details. <br><br> A title given to swordsmen who have cut an enemy's soul with a sword of the mind. Slightly increases the power and speed of swords forged with the mind.<br><br>Raon exclaimed in surprise the moment he confirmed the title's effects.<br><br>'This is no joke.'<br><br>Soul Sword is a decisive yet beautiful martial art that determines battles in an instant. Even a slight increase in power and speed could mean defeating previously unbeatable opponents, making this an incredible reward. Considering his growth trajectory, this title might be the most significant reward he received today.<br><br>-W-why would they give this!<br><br>Wrath screamed as soon as he read the title's effects.<br><br>-Creating something like this requires pouring in an insane amount of my power!<br><br>He cursed at the system, asking if it had gone mad.<br><br>'You were encouraging me just now, but your thoughts have already changed?'<br><br>-Encourage? Encooourage? When did I ever encourage you!<br><br>Wrath furrowed his brow, claiming he had never had such thoughts.<br><br>'Sigh...'<br><br>Raon let out an empty breath.<br><br>'So that was your true feelings?'<br><br>It seemed Wrath hadn't been encouraging him just now, but genuinely mocking him. His fondness for Wrath suddenly cooled.<br><br>"Ah well..."<br><br>As Raon sighed with his eyes lowered, the door to his room opened with a thud, and Evelyn entered wearing a neatly pressed maid's uniform.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>Raon slightly furrowed his brow as he looked at Evelyn.<br><br>'Why did it have to be Evelyn?'<br><br>He had wanted to review the reward messages and plan his future growth, but with Evelyn here, things were likely to get noisy.<br><br>"You're awake."<br><br>However, contrary to his expectations, Evelyn didn't shout but quietly entered the room and closed the door.<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>Raon leaned back as he saw Evelyn's eerie smile.<br><br>"Why are you closing the door..."<br><br>"Because I wanted to have you all to myself right after you woke up."<br><br>Evelyn's beautiful smile appeared to him like a chilling sneer.<br><br>-That madwoman...<br><br>Wrath trembled his tail, unable to even look at Evelyn.<br><br>-She came every day and stared at you intently for 12 hours straight. I thought I was going to die of fear!<br><br>He let out a heavy breath, saying Evelyn's obsession surpassed even Lust's.<br><br>'Ugh...'<br><br>As soon as he heard Wrath's words, he felt an icy chill run down his spine. Come to think of it, he remembered hearing Evelyn's happy voice even when he fainted at the White Blood Religion.<br><br>"M-Mom! Dad!"<br><br>He called for his mother and father like a child, but neither appeared.<br><br>"I used a sound-erasing magic."<br><br>Evelyn lifted one leg onto the bed, suggesting they spend some happy time together.<br><br>"Uh... Ah!"<br><br>Raon exclaimed as he backed away on the bed. A good idea to stop Evelyn had occurred to him.<br><br>"C-Come to think of it, what happened after I passed out? What about Darkan? And the Head of House?"<br><br>He asked about what happened after he fainted to divert Evelyn's attention.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Evelyn stopped in her tracks and frowned without answering.<br><br>"I can't tell you about that."<br><br>"Huh? Why?"<br><br>Raon's eyes widened.<br><br>"Grandfather said he would tell you himself. He asked for you to come to the Lord's Manor when you wake up."<br><br>Evelyn sighed regretfully, saying she couldn't ignore Glenn's words.<br><br>-Ah, this household had another obsessive maniac...<br><br>Wrath took a sharp breath as he remembered.<br><br>-That grandson-obsessed old geezer! During the 12 hours when that madwoman wasn't here, that old man was here instead!<br><br>***<br><br>The brutal war had ended, and silence fell over the White Blood Religion Headquarters. From the ground where white blood had melted away, a red haze rose.<br><br>[...kill them.]<br><br>A young woman's voice eerily spread around the haze. It was a voice thick with hatred and killing intent.<br><br>[I'll kill every last one of them!]<br><br>It was the voice of the Leader of the White Blood Religion. The residual thought she left behind at the moment her soul perished crawled up from the ground with its own will.<br><br>[After I grow stronger, Raon Zieghart and Martha Zieghart... No, I'll destroy the entire Zieghart family. Derus Robert! You're next!]<br><br>The Leader's residual thought revealed deep malice, as if wanting to destroy not just the Zieghart family but the entire world. With a whoosh, the residual thought transformed its red haze body into a bat and flew into the sky.<br><br>[I am of the immortal noble race...]<br><br>Just as she spread her wings and entered the forest beside the port town, a white energy stream shot up from beneath the trees and pierced through the Leader's body.<br><br>[Screeeech!]<br><br>The Leader's residual thought screamed as it fell to the ground.<br><br>[Ughh...]<br><br>As she trembled all over and lifted her gaze, a man with white hair reaching his waist emerged from beneath the trees.<br><br>[You, you are!]<br><br>"You came out just as expected."<br><br>Lawrence. The man who had been hiding in the Holy Sword Alliance, targeting only the Leader of the White Blood Religion, tilted his chin.<br><br>"Your will to live is more tenacious than anyone else's."<br><br>He sneered as if he had expected the Leader's residual thought would appear.<br><br>"Though I didn't expect only a residual thought would remain, not even a soul fragment. Seems Raon's Soul Sword worked properly."<br><br>Lawrence clicked his tongue as if slightly disappointed.<br><br>[H-how are you here...]<br><br>"I'm here because I'm me. Because I know you better than anyone."<br><br>He shook his head with a cold smile.<br><br>"Ah, being just a residual thought, perhaps you can't understand?"<br><br>Lawrence scoffed as he grabbed the bat-shaped residual thought of the Leader in his hand.<br><br>"In this state, you could create a new soul by drinking human malice and blood to grow, but that won't happen now."<br><br>He smiled as he tore off the bat-shaped Leader's wings and burned them.<br><br>[Screeeech!]<br><br>The White Blood Religion Leader’s residual thought screamed in agony, just as it would have if its original body were still alive.<br><br>[W-wait! Hold on. I can...]<br><br>The Leader's residual thought struggled desperately, releasing faint bloody energy as if clinging to life.<br><br>"Shut up. Just disappear."<br><br>As Lawrence released white flames gathered in both hands, the White Blood Religion Leader's residual thought began to burn along with its bat body.<br><br>[Aaaaargh!]<br><br>"Denier Zieghart was right. You should never have existed in this world."<br><br>With a bitter voice, Lawrence watched as the last traces of the White Blood Religion Leader’s existence were completely erased.<br><br>"Haa..."<br><br>Lawrence closed his eyes and heaved a sigh heavy enough to sink the ground, seemingly experiencing multiple emotions at once.<br><br>"Is this really..."<br><br>Rector emerged from behind Lawrence with a low groan.<br><br>"Will you be satisfied with this?"<br><br>He narrowed his eyes as if asking if Lawrence would be okay.<br><br>"The real one was destroyed by Raon and Martha, and what you just killed was literally just a residual thought. Even if it had hidden and grown stronger, it would have become a different being from the Leader."<br><br>Rector deeply furrowed his brows, seeming worried about Lawrence not achieving his revenge.<br><br>"This is enough."<br><br>Lawrence dusted off his hands as if satisfied.<br><br>"Those children and that sword had deeper ties than mine. Just witnessing that was enough."<br><br>He drew a thin smile, saying he felt satisfaction through watching Martha and Raon's fight.<br><br>"Besides, you and I did participate in the war."<br><br>Lawrence calmly rubbed his chin, saying they won thanks to their support from behind.<br><br>"Even so..."<br><br>"We need to think about what's next. Derus's eyes could be anywhere, so it was right not to reveal the Holy Sword Alliance here."<br><br>He looked at Rector with calm eyes, suggesting they should prepare for the future.<br><br>"That future is my responsibility. It's not your concern..."<br><br>"You interfered in my life, so I need to interfere in yours to make it even."<br><br>Lawrence snorted and walked past Rector into a cave deep in the forest. Inside lay men in white clothes who appeared to be Angels and black-masked assassins, all collapsed with their eyes still open.<br><br>"We need to throw these into the sea, so get ready."<br><br>Until now, there were too many people around to dispose of the bodies, but now that the Five Kings' martial artists had left, they could throw them into the sea.<br><br>"Fine. I understand."<br><br>Despite his words of agreement, Rector turned his gaze back to the White Blood Religion Headquarters. He smiled softly as he looked at the ground where Raon had fought until the end.<br><br>"Well done, my grandson."<br><br>***<br><br>'Since it's late now...'<br><br>Raon clicked his tongue briefly as he looked at the moonlight falling through the window.<br><br>'It would be better to go after sunrise.'<br><br>Though Glenn had asked him to come immediately, since it was dawn now, it seemed better to go to the Lord's Manor after daybreak.<br><br>'Now that I've sent Evelyn away too, should I go back to sleep?'<br><br>As he closed his eyes to go back to sleep, since not all his injuries had healed yet, a sharp sword wind sound came from the lakeside.<br><br>'Is it Sister?'<br><br>He naturally smiled as he felt Sia's distinctive sword aura that he had taught her.<br><br>'She's improved a lot.'<br><br>Just from the sound of the sword wind, he could tell how much Sia's swordsmanship had improved. It was only natural, given that a genius like her was working so hard.<br><br>'Yes. Just like that... Hm?'<br><br>As Raon was about to close his eyes, using Sia's sword wind sounds as a lullaby, he heard a somehow familiar man's voice from the lakeside. Since it wasn't Edgar or Julius, he focused his aura on his hearing.<br><br>"Is this how you do it?"<br><br>"Perfect! You're overflowing with talent! No, you're almost at your brother's level!"<br><br>"Really?"<br><br>"I'm telling you! Want to spar with me?"<br><br>Sia and the man chatted warmly like old acquaintances.<br><br>'Spar? Who could it be?'<br><br>Unable to contain his curiosity, Raon opened the window and went outside. As he approached the lake, he saw a tall man standing next to Sia, observing her swordsmanship.<br><br>'That back of the head looks familiar... Gasp!'<br><br>Raon's jaw dropped as he looked at the man's back.<br><br>"D-Darkan!"<br><br>The back of Darkan's head, which he had seen countless times during their beggar training sessions, was right there next to Sia.<br><br>"Why are you here!"<br><br>"Oh! You're awake!"<br><br>Darkan turned to him with a refreshing smile.<br><br>"Your sister's swordsmanship is quite interesting! May I spar with her?"<br><br>He waved at Raon like an old friend.<br><br>"Of course not!"<br><br>Raon couldn't hold back and shouted.<br><br>"You crazy bastard!"</p>
