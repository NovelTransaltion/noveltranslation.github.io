        <p>"Phew."<br><br>After confirming that Raon had entered the White Blood Religion Headquarters, Martha shook off the bloody energy remaining in her wounds.<br><br>"Father."<br><br>She bowed respectfully to Denier, who stood protectively at her right side.<br><br>"Thank you for your help. Thanks to you, I was able to come to my senses."<br><br>Though she had fought foolishly with blood rushing to her head due to the 12th Apostle's provocation, thanks to Denier, she escaped with only minor wounds.<br><br>If he hadn't helped, she would have already been skewered by the 10th Apostle's spear.<br><br>"Martha. You..."<br><br>Denier let out a low breath, as if realizing what he was about to say.<br><br>"I'm fine now."<br><br>Martha clenched her sword grip while grinding her molars.<br><br>"I'll kill the 10th Apostle with my own hands. Father, please help the others."<br><br>She bowed her head as she declared this was a fight she needed to finish herself.<br><br>"Can you really do it?"<br><br>"I have your sword technique. I can win."<br><br>This wasn't like before, declaring victory thoughtlessly while blinded by vengeance.<br><br>With the Crushing Ocean Sword that Denier had taught her, she could significantly narrow the gap in martial prowess between herself and the 10th Apostle. It was a fight worth attempting.<br><br>"Haa..."<br><br>Denier sighed with furrowed brows, seemingly realizing he couldn't stop her.<br><br>"Very well. But tell me immediately if it becomes dangerous."<br><br>He stepped back five paces, as if indicating he would wait there.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Without lowering his sword, Denier stared intensely not at Martha, but at the 10th Apostle's eyes.<br><br>"Sorry to keep you waiting."<br><br>Martha nodded to the 10th Apostle, who had waited without attacking while she and Denier conversed.<br><br>"It's been nearly twenty years, but I haven't forgotten that day for even a moment since I first saw you."<br><br>The moment when her peaceful, close-knit village - though neither large nor wealthy - burst into flames and was drenched in bright red blood remained etched in her mind. That hell of blood and burning smells, people's screams, and the Blood Demons' laughter still stayed with her.<br><br>"I still have nightmares every day. I always wake up from the scene where my mother hides me and smiles even as you capture her. Cold sweat runs down my body, and my face turns pale."<br><br>Martha gripped her sword so tightly her joints cracked.<br><br>"Today I'll shatter those memories and those nightmares!"<br><br>She gritted her teeth and pointed her sword at the 10th Apostle's neck.<br><br>"You have earned the right. If you're that resentful, try to take your revenge."<br><br>The 10th Apostle raised his spear and pointed it at her heart, as if accepting her challenge.<br><br>"Stop pretending to be a martial artist when you're just a Blood Demon! It's disgusting!"<br><br>Martha roared and charged at the 10th Apostle.<br><br>The 10th Apostle thrust his spear before Martha could close in, taking advantage of its longer reach.<br><br>"Hmph!"<br><br>Martha twisted her ankle to avoid the 10th Apostle's spear blade and tried to push in closer, but his spear strikes didn't come alone.<br><br>The 10th Apostle's spear strikes multiplied into hundreds, raining down on Martha's vital points.<br><br>Martha gave up her charge and used her footwork to deflect the spear strikes.<br><br>'They're fast, but I can dodge them.'<br><br>Perhaps due to Raon's two months of hell training, she could now dodge the spear strikes of the 10th Apostle, who had reached a far higher level than her.<br><br>'However...'<br><br>Martha frowned as she deflected the 10th Apostle's spear aimed at her chest.<br><br>'It's not easy to get close.'<br><br>She was strongest in close combat.<br><br>Though she wanted to close in to deny the 10th Apostle his advantageous range, his spear strikes were too fast and their movements too mysterious to approach.<br><br>"You've certainly become different from the child of that day."<br><br>The 10th Apostle slowly closed and opened his eyes before stepping forward and delivering a lightning-fast spear strike to the left.<br><br>As Martha turned to her right, the 10th Apostle's suddenly redirected spear strike cut her left arm. Flesh tore where the spear grazed her skin, and red blood flowed.<br><br>'His spear technique has changed.'<br><br>The 10th Apostle, seeming to realize his previous technique wouldn't be enough to catch her, now wielded an even faster and more powerful spear technique.<br><br>His form transitions were fluid, and the increased speed and power made his attacks harder to deflect.<br><br>"But it still means nothing."<br><br>The 10th Apostle thrust his increasingly powerful spear strikes without the slightest change in expression, as if wounding her was only natural.<br><br>Martha frowned as she deflected the 10th Apostle's spear strikes aimed at her neck.<br><br>'At this rate, I'll die by his spear without even putting up a proper fight.'<br><br>Even though she had grown stronger, the 10th Apostle was still far more powerful. If she kept getting pushed back like this, she would die without landing even a single strike.<br><br>'I can't let that happen.'<br><br>Martha charged toward the 10th Apostle's spear strikes that were rushing at her like a northern wind.<br><br>'Even if I die, I have to at least leave a mark on that bastard's neck!'<br><br>During hell training, Raon had always taught her to focus on her strengths. Her strength wasn't evasion, but the charging power to sacrifice flesh and grind bone. She gritted her teeth, determined to kill with a thrust even if it meant taking a hit. <br><br>Martha pivoted her ankle forward. Instead of dodging the spear, she advanced toward the 10th Apostle while swinging her sword down.<br><br>The dominating sword strike of the Crushing Ocean Sword clashed with the 10th Apostle's fierce spear thrust.<br><br>Martha bit her lip as she felt the powerful recoil. Even though she had defended in time, her bones and muscles ached, and her skin tore. The 10th Apostle was clearly standing at a higher level than her.<br><br>'I already knew he was stronger than me.'<br><br>She must never retreat! If her body was pushed back, her spirit would follow. Even at a cost, she had to keep moving forward.<br><br>'I'll keep using the Crushing Ocean Sword.'<br><br>The Crushing Ocean Sword was a special technique that grew stronger the more evil energy it cut through.<br><br>Even if she was being pushed back now, if she kept fighting, she could unleash a sword that wouldn't lose to the 10th Apostle.<br><br>Martha advanced one step at a time while deflecting the rain of spear strikes.<br><br>As she pressed forward with heavy steps, determined never to break, she soon reached close enough to hear the 10th Apostle's breathing.<br><br>"Hmm!"<br><br>The 10th Apostle furrowed his brows as he saw Martha's unwavering eyes.<br><br>"Don't be surprised yet!"<br><br>Martha aimed for the 10th Apostle's neck with her strengthened Crushing Ocean Sword, breaking through his bloody energy.<br><br>The 10th Apostle quickly swung his spear shaft to block her sword strike.<br><br>At that moment, the flow of the Crushing Ocean Sword suddenly intensified, breaking through the 10th Apostle's defense and carving a long gash across his shoulder.<br><br>"This is..."<br><br>The 10th Apostle let out a thin groan as he watched white blood flow from his shoulder.<br><br>"What is this energy?"<br><br>He frowned as he looked at the brown aura emanating from Martha's sword, seemingly unable to understand it.<br><br>"You still don't know even after seeing it?"<br><br>Martha twisted her lips as she burned her aura, which blazed thick like an axe blade.<br><br>"It's the reaper that will kill you Blood Demons."<br><br>***<br><br>Martha frowned as she watched the 10th Apostle's spear block her Crushing Ocean Sword strike.<br><br>'That bastard...'<br><br>He's adapting to the Crushing Ocean Sword.<br><br>Though she had thought she could win like this, the 10th Apostle, befitting his status as a peak Grandmaster martial artist, had recognized the danger of the Crushing Ocean Sword and was now avoiding direct confrontation while targeting her openings. It was an annoying fighting style to deal with.<br><br>'Even if my sword technique becomes predictable, I have to keep swinging.'<br><br>The only reason she could face the peak Grandmaster 10th Apostle was because of the Crushing Ocean Sword.<br><br>She had to keep pressing forward despite the difficulty, because the moment she switched to a different sword technique to avoid revealing information about the Crushing Ocean Sword, her head would be cut off. <br><br>Martha aimed for the 10th Apostle's chest with a gracefully curved strike of the Crushing Ocean Sword, like a crescent moon.<br><br>"Now I see it."<br><br>However, the 10th Apostle, having seemingly grasped the flow of the Crushing Ocean Sword, perfectly evaded her sword with just three steps.<br><br>The 10th Apostle, showing no intention of stopping at evasion, twisted his spear blade and thrust it toward her shoulder.<br><br>She tried to block with a defensive form of the Crushing Ocean Sword, but the spear strike bent strangely and cut deeply across her waist.<br><br>"Ughk..."<br><br>Martha bit her lip as she clutched her bleeding waist.<br><br>"Your sword technique has the ability to push back bloody energy. It's certainly threatening, but..."<br><br>The 10th Apostle stroked his chin as he shook the red blood off his spear blade.<br><br>"Your level can't keep up with that ability. This is the end."<br><br>His eyes flashed with killing intent as if declaring it was all over.<br><br>"Don't spout nonsense!"<br><br>Martha screamed as she charged at the 10th Apostle. She swung her Crushing Ocean Sword down at his head.<br><br>The 10th Apostle, as if proving his words about this being the end were sincere, easily blocked her Crushing Ocean Sword strike and stabbed her shoulder.<br><br>"For something you called the end, that wasn't much."<br><br>Martha sneered, ignoring the wound in her shoulder.<br><br>'Damn it.'<br><br>Though she acted calm, cold sweat ran down her back. The wound was bad because she'd been stabbed in the same place again. If not treated quickly, there might be lasting effects. Martha chewed her lip as she turned her eyes to the right.<br><br>'Father.'<br><br>Even while cutting down the Archbishop and Blood Demons, Denier kept glancing her way with concern.<br><br>'I have to do this properly.'<br><br>Because of her, Denier, the Wise Martial Palace, and the Light Wind Palace couldn't move freely. Since she had stepped forward claiming she could win, she had to fight to the end and emerge victorious, no matter what.<br><br>'I can't show a shameful sight to Raon either.'<br><br>Raon had set up today's battle to keep his promise of rescuing her mother from the Leader of the White Blood Religion.<br><br>He had told her not to stop at fighting the 10th Apostle, which meant she was needed for the battle against the Leader of the White Blood Religion, so she absolutely couldn't stop here.<br><br>However, to reach that fight, she first had to overcome the 10th Apostle before her.<br><br>"Kraaaa!"<br><br>Martha roared as she charged forward and swung her sword at the 10th Apostle's neck.<br><br>"Already falling apart?"<br><br>The 10th Apostle was shaking his head disapprovingly at Martha's wavering sword as he raised his spear.<br><br>The fighting spirit in Martha's sword suddenly intensified, pushing back the white bloody energy and spear shaft to carve a deep wound in the 10th Apostle's chest.<br><br>"Who's falling apart?"<br><br>Martha shook her head as she flicked the 10th Apostle's white blood off her sword.<br><br>"I won't break until I've crushed and killed you and that damned mosquito woman!"<br><br>With a roar, she unleashed a series of Crushing Ocean Sword forms, cutting through the 10th Apostle's bloody energy.<br><br>She poured out all the aura and strength she had been saving for later battles into this moment. <br><br>The 10th Apostle, as if revealing he hadn't been fighting at full power either, wrapped his entire spear shaft in mist-like bloody energy as he deflected her slash.<br><br>As sword and spear clashed countless times at close range, the castle wall crumbled, and Martha and the 10th Apostle fell toward the shore.<br><br>Martha wrinkled her nose as she watched the 10th Apostle's spear technique, which was now blocking the flow of her Crushing Ocean Sword by densely concentrating bloody energy.<br><br>'Has he adapted even to my full-power Crushing Ocean Sword?'<br><br>How should she defeat this bastard?<br><br>The more they fought, the more the 10th Apostle adapted to the Crushing Ocean Sword, causing her to be pushed back again despite using her full power.<br><br>'At least we're on solid ground now.'<br><br>Perhaps because she was focused on the fight, she could clearly feel the power the earth was transmitting to her. She had the highest affinity with earth energy, and the Titan's Aura was also strengthened on land, so she felt she could draw out a bit more power.<br><br>'But that alone won't be enough.'<br><br>As Martha bit her lip and shook her head, her eyes met those of Runaan and Burren who were watching her fight. Their eyes held not just worry but intense emotion. They looked ready to abandon their own battles and rush to her aid if she was pushed back any further.<br><br>'This is my fight.'<br><br>She shook her head at them, signaling them not to interfere.<br><br>"Then win...!"<br><br>Runaan shouted for the first time in her life. Her cry, coming from someone who had become as precious as family, created deep reverberations in Martha's heart - no, in her soul.<br><br>"I'll believe in you."<br><br>Unlike Runaan, Burren calmly nodded before returning to lead the Light Wind Palace. Seeing his back, which seemed to radiate trust, made her heart tremble even more. Martha gave a faint smile as she looked at Burren's back and Runaan's eyes.<br><br>'I've fought alongside them so many times.'<br><br>Memories flooded back of their countless fights, both during training at the Fifth Training Ground and when receiving additional training from Rimmer to unlock the Sword Domain.<br><br>'It was both good and bad... Ah!'<br><br>Martha's eyes widened as she deflected the 10th Apostle's spear strike while thinking about the past.<br><br>'It might be possible now.'<br><br>Thanks to the soul resonance she felt through Runaan and Burren, and the burning energy transmitted from the earth, she realized the only way to defeat the 10th Apostle.<br><br>"Let me ask you one thing."<br><br>She parted her lips as she looked up at the 10th Apostle behind his spear shaft.<br><br>"What do you think about when you kidnap innocent people and drink their blood?"<br><br>"...Nothing."<br><br>The 10th Apostle shook his head, saying he thought nothing of it, just as people think nothing of eating their meals.<br><br>"In the end, you're just the same."<br><br>Martha curled her lips into a long smile.<br><br>"I'm glad. That you all remain creatures deserving death."<br><br>She stepped forward as if to shatter the entire world. While channeling the earth's energy into her body and soul, she unleashed the willpower and mental images she had built up as a swordsman.<br><br>"Sword Domain."<br><br>Martha held her sword in reverse grip like a knight's statue, raising it before her chest and pointing it at the ground.<br><br>'Even if I can't use a sword after today, that's fine. But in exchange...'<br><br>Just for today! Making a Soul Oath to substitute for Zieghart's blood, she drew out the deep, profound malice she had accumulated against the White Blood Religion.<br><br>"Devil's Prison!"<br><br>Behind Martha, a hell gate connected by red blood materialized.</p>
