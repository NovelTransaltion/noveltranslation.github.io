        <p>"Did you just say the former Holy Sword Alliance Leader?"<br><br>Raon swallowed hard as he looked at Rector, who had mentioned the name of the former Holy Sword Alliance Leader.<br><br>"You know about him too, don't you?"<br><br>Rector emptied his glass with a calm gaze.<br><br>"Only the Destructive King of the North and the former Holy Sword Alliance Leader can handle the Five Demons' leaders one-on-one."<br><br>He slowly turned his gaze as if to say he knew better.<br><br>"Of course, it would be different if those two retired hermits appeared, but it's been a long time since those two disappeared."<br><br>Rector shook his head as if to say not to get one's hopes up.<br><br>"What about Derus and the Leader of the White Blood Religion, whom you saw in person?"<br><br>Raon asked, clasping his hands together, requesting an explanation of their martial prowess first.<br><br>"The Leader of the White Blood Religion's bloody energy was terrifyingly vast and stable. It seemed like she had made all of the Beast King's martial prowess her own and ascended to an even higher level."<br><br>Rector let out a heavy sigh, saying that he didn't think he could defeat the Leader of the White Blood Religion even if he fought with all his might.<br><br>"And Derus Robert..."<br><br>He furrowed his brow, placing his fingers on his forehead.<br><br>"He was completely unreadable. It was clear that he had reached a level that could surpass Transcendence, though perhaps not as much as Lord Glenn."<br><br>Rector poured himself a drink with trembling hands, saying that Derus was on an entirely different level.<br><br>"I don't know about the Heavenly Demon since he didn't come to the conference, but he's probably above or at least not below Derus."<br><br>He shook his head, saying that none of the three—the Heavenly Demon, Derus, and the Leader of the White Blood Religion—would be easy to deal with.<br><br>"I see..."<br><br>Raon bit his lip as he looked at the empty plate.<br><br>'Numerically, the Five Kings are far superior, but the Five Demons have more top-tier Transcendents who can change the tide of war.'<br><br>Even if Glenn were to face the Heavenly Demon after starting the war with the White Blood Religion, Derus Robert would remain. Derus possessed enough martial prowess to overwhelm King Lecross, so it would be impossible to stop him with the remaining people.<br><br>'Lord Ogram and Lady Chamber haven't fully recovered from their injuries.'<br><br>If the Beast King and the Archmage of Glory were in perfect condition, they might be able to buy some time, but right now, both of them can't use their full martial prowess. It was clear they wouldn't be able to withstand even a single strike from Derus.<br><br>'If Derus and the Heavenly Demon abandon their support and launch a counterattack when we attack the White Blood Religion...'<br><br>Three of the Five Kings would fall. Even if Glenn uses spatial movement to block the Heavenly Demon, Derus would move to destroy Owen and the magic tower, and then kill Ogram, who would be alone.<br><br>'The Derus I know would definitely move like that.'<br><br>Derus Robert is not the type to support his allies. It was clear he would use them as bait to achieve his own goals.<br><br>'He'll definitely try to kill the Beast King first.'<br><br>The moment the Leader of the White Blood Religion dies, her curse will disappear, allowing the Beast King to regain his original martial prowess. Since this is something Derus wouldn't want, he would surely target Ogram first.<br><br>'Then if we put the Beast King next to Grandfather... No, that could be even more dangerous if Derus and the Heavenly Demon attack together.'<br><br>Since Derus could use the power of Angels to move through space, it was difficult and complicated to form a strategy.<br><br>'And if an Archangel moves as well...'<br><br>It would be nothing short of a disaster. Derus Robert hadn't actively moved Uriel and the other Archangels as if he was waiting for the right moment, but if even one of them appeared, the problem would become much bigger.<br><br>'Attacking might actually result in a loss.'<br><br>His jaw clenched at the thought that all the preparations made so far could be in vain.<br><br>"It's just as Grandfather said."<br><br>Raon let out a deep sigh.<br><br>"There's no one except him."<br><br>After turning it over in his mind several times, it seemed there was no one who could stop Derus except the former Holy Sword Alliance Leader.<br><br>"Yes. After seeing Derus and the Leader of the White Blood Religion in person, I could only think of seeking out the Dark Night Sword God."<br><br>Rector nodded, saying he wanted to try to stop Derus by any means necessary.<br><br>"When you said earlier that you found him..."<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he looked at Rector.<br><br>"Does that mean you met the Dark Night Sword God?"<br><br>"That's right."<br><br>Rector replied as he raised his glass.<br><br>"At first, I thought he was around the Holy Sword Alliance's Holy Ground, but he had left long ago. Thanks to investing quite a bit of time, I was able to find Darkan."<br><br>He said he had barely managed to find Darkan through connections he had made during his travels, and downed his drink in one go.<br><br>"However, persuasion didn't work."<br><br>Rector twisted his lips as he gripped his glass tightly.<br><br>"He said my sword was uninteresting and he didn't want to hear what I had to say."<br><br>He snorted, saying that words didn't get through to him at all.<br><br>-It seems he's still obsessed with swords.<br><br>Wrath clicked his tongue, saying he could clearly picture the Dark Night Sword God's state.<br><br>-Well, he's the guy who gouged out his own eyes to reach a higher level.<br><br>He stuck out his tongue, saying it was an obsession that bordered on terrifying.<br><br>"Uninteresting, he says..."<br><br>Raon shook his head as he tapped the table with his fingers.<br><br>'Would it work if I went?'<br><br>While the Dark Night Sword God Darkan's main goal was to duel Glenn, he also had great interest in Raon himself. If he went in person, they might be able to communicate.<br><br>"Where is the Dark Night Sword God now?"<br><br>"He was in the Kingdom of Oscott. I was able to find him quickly because he was near the holy ground."<br><br>Rector sighed as he mentioned the name of the Kingdom of Oscott.<br><br>"Oscott?"<br><br>Raon's eyes widened. He was surprised to hear the name of a kingdom that seemed least likely to be associated with the Dark Night Sword God Darkan.<br><br>"Why is he there..."<br><br>"You wouldn't believe me if I told you what he's doing."<br><br>Rector shook his head, saying it would be impossible to explain.<br><br>"Then let's go see for ourselves."<br><br>Raon clenched his right hand into a fist. It seemed better to move and create change, even a little, rather than doing nothing and relying on luck.<br><br>"It could be dangerous. Darkan isn't in his right mind right now."<br><br>"If we can't take risks, opportunities won't come. And..."<br><br>Raon smiled faintly as he took Rector's hand.<br><br>"If I'm in danger, you'll protect me, won't you, Grandfather?"<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Rector bit his lip hard as he looked at his own hand with trembling eyes.<br><br>"O-Of course! I'll protect you even if I die on the spot!"<br><br>He nodded firmly as if to say not to worry.<br><br>-Wow...<br><br>Wrath let out an exasperated breath.<br><br>-This damn guy is even charming his own grandfather now...<br><br>He shook his head, saying Raon was becoming more and more like a ghost.<br><br>"Are you going right away then?"<br><br>"No. I need a little time."<br><br>Raon smiled coldly as he looked out the darkened window.<br><br>"I need to take care of our kids first."<br><br>***<br><br>The sound of sword wind shattering the dawn air echoed. Even though the sun had not yet risen, the swordsmen of the fifth training ground were honing their swordsmanship with heightened concentration.<br><br>"Five-minute break!"<br><br>Martha, who was in charge of the dawn training, raised her hand to order a brief rest.<br><br>"I'll continue a bit more."<br><br>"I'll forfeit my break time too!"<br><br>The swordsmen either continued swinging their swords or practiced footwork, refusing the break time.<br><br>"Why are you all so enthusiastic?"<br><br>Martha furrowed her brow as she rested her sword on her shoulder.<br><br>"You weren't this intense even when Raon was training you."<br><br>She shook her head, saying she didn't understand.<br><br>"Are you stupid, Miss Rakshasa?"<br><br>Runaan looked up at Martha with dull eyes.<br><br>"Why else? It's because of you."<br><br>Burren licked his lips as he gripped his sword with both hands.<br><br>“This time, we have to fight the White Blood Religion! They’re the enemies of our Division Leader!”<br><br>"We should become stronger even if it means saving time!"<br><br>Yua and Julius bowed their heads in unison, saying it was only natural to train to the best of their abilities.<br><br>"It's scary, but we have to do as much as we can..."<br><br>Dorian's hands were shaking as if the war had already started, but he didn't stop training.<br><br>"I can do anything for Martha! This time, I'll behead the apostle and..."<br><br>As Krein was flattering Martha, licking his lips,<br><br>"That's good. You can do anything, you say."<br><br>Raon entered the training ground with a grin.<br><br>"Pa-Palace Master!"<br><br>"You must be tired. Did you come right away?"<br><br>"Did your business go well?"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace Swordsmen smiled and ran towards Raon, happy to see him after a long time.<br><br>"Thanks to our cute informant, we've found the location of the White Blood Religion Headquarters."<br><br>Raon briefly explained to the Light Wind Palace Swordsmen what had happened.<br><br>"I thought we'd need new training since it's clear the upcoming war will take place at sea, but..."<br><br>He grinned as he looked at Krein, who was trembling with anxiety.<br><br>"It's fortunate that you say you can do anything."<br><br>Raon patted Krein's shoulder, saying he was grateful.<br><br>"Ugh!"<br><br>"Oh no..."<br><br>“K-r-e-i-n.”<br><br>"That bastard's mouth, really!"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace Swordsmen gritted their teeth as they glared at Krein, sensing something ominous in his words.<br><br>"No, you all said similar things..."<br><br>Krein sniffled as he looked at his comrades nervously.<br><br>"There's no need to worry too much. I'm not asking you to do anything difficult, just train in the sea. In a way, it could be like a vacation."<br><br>Raon wagged his finger at the angry Light Wind Palace Swordsmen.<br><br>"The s-sea?"<br><br>"A vacation, you say..."<br><br>"Is that true?"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace Swordsmen widened their eyes in disbelief.<br><br>"As I said, the war with the White Blood Religion will take place at sea. So we need to adapt to the sea."<br><br>He smiled faintly, saying it wasn't anything difficult or hard, just swinging swords underwater.<br><br>"That's fine then!"<br><br>Krein raised his hand enthusiastically, seeming to have regained his spirit.<br><br>"The sea around there is clean and warm. It won't be bad for training!"<br><br>He let out a sigh of relief, as if all his worries had disappeared.<br><br>"True, it's been a while since we fought at sea, so we should adapt."<br><br>Burren nodded, saying it wasn't a bad idea.<br><br>"Yeah. We couldn't train properly when we were on missions because of people's gazes."<br><br>Trevin also agreed it was a good idea, clenching his sword-wielding hand.<br><br>"Miss Rakshasa..."<br><br>Runaan narrowed her eyes, seeming worried about Martha as the mood brightened.<br><br>"Are you okay with this?"<br><br>"Of course it's okay. We've been training so rigidly, loosening up a bit might actually help."<br><br>Martha nodded, saying that since it was Raon's training, there must be a purpose to it.<br><br>"Then everyone agrees."<br><br>Raon's eyes turned cold as he looked at the smiling Light Wind Palace Swordsmen.<br><br>"Let's go right away."<br><br>***<br><br>A bitterly cold wind that seemed to tear flesh and pierce bone howled, and waves that cut through the frozen sea like an icebreaker surged in the northern sea. The Light Wind Palace Swordsmen stood on the most treacherous sea, named the North Sea, wearing only swimsuits.<br><br>"Wh-What is this?"<br><br>Krein looked at the fiercely churning sea with blue-tinged, trembling lips.<br><br>"You said it was a vacation! This is hell!"<br><br>He shivered, saying he felt like he was going to freeze to death.<br><br>"Tricked again..."<br><br>Burren shook his head as he rubbed his arms, which were covered in goosebumps from the cold.<br><br>"I told you we shouldn't trust that madman!"<br><br>He shouted at Raon, calling him a madman, forgetting that he should address him as Palace Master.<br><br>"I like it though?"<br><br>Runaan was stretching, showing unusual vigor instead of her typical dullness. It seemed she could withstand this level of cold due to her use of cold aura.<br><br>"I thought I heard the devil laughing in the Palace Master's heart..."<br><br>Dorian chattered his teeth, saying he had predicted this situation from the moment he saw it with his Mind's Eye.<br><br>"Da-Damn it! I'll never believe that guy again!"<br><br>"It's this cold just above the water, we'll freeze solid if we go in!"<br><br>"If we go a little to the side from here, it's Habun Castle! This is just the North Sea!"<br><br>The swordsmen's eyes welled up with tears, seemingly terrified just by looking at the sea. Splash! While everyone was shivering from the cold, Martha fearlessly leaped into the sea filled with floating ice.<br><br>"No time! Get in quickly!"<br><br>She beckoned them to come in, her lips trembling as even she couldn't fully withstand the northern cold.<br><br>"Okay!"<br><br>Runaan dove into the sea even more refreshingly than Martha.<br><br>"This is perfect!"<br><br>She gave a thumbs up to the swordsmen, as if the inside was better.<br><br>"Argh!"<br><br>Burren jumped into the sea with a scream. He too seemed to find it difficult to endure, his eyes trembling as he gasped for breath.<br><br>"To hell with it!"<br><br>"I'm going in too!"<br><br>"Aaargh!"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace Swordsmen all jumped into the sea together, unable to bear watching their comrades enter one by one.<br><br>-Oh!<br><br>Wrath whistled in surprise.<br><br>-In the past, they wouldn't have moved until you pushed them in, but they've all changed.<br><br>'It's because they're family now.'<br><br>Raon smiled faintly as he watched the swordsmen draw their swords, their teeth chattering.<br><br>'They want to become stronger to help Martha.'<br><br>The cold energy of Glacier that he had placed was also permeating this sea. It would be much colder than the usual North Sea, but he was touched by the swordsmen enduring it for Martha's sake.<br><br>"Now then, everyone dive and practice your swordsmanship underwater."<br><br>Raon clapped his hands, saying to begin.<br><br>"Di-Dive?"<br><br>"Not here?"<br><br>"You're in-insane..."<br><br>The swordsmen's eyes shook as if they were about to pop out, not expecting to have to dive as well.<br><br>"Yes. If you come up without completing one full sword technique underwater..."<br><br>Raon raised the scabbard of the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>"You'd better look forward to it."<br><br>He smiled wickedly, saying he'd smack their heads.<br><br>"We start now. Three, two, one."<br><br>As soon as Raon counted one, all the swordsmen who had their heads above water went underwater.<br><br>"Ju-Just a moment. I need to prepare mentally... Ack!"<br><br>He struck Krein's head, who was holding his nose and preparing.<br><br>"It hurts like hell!"<br><br>Krein screamed and went into the sea, clutching his head.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>As Raon was smacking his lips and fondling the scabbard, the surface rippled and Dorian popped up.<br><br>"Huff! Huff! Just a moment..."<br><br>"Again."<br><br>Raon twisted his lips upward and tapped Dorian's head with the scabbard.<br><br>"Aargh!"<br><br>Dorian screamed and went back underwater.<br><br>"This isn't training, it's torture... Gack!"<br><br>"Just a moment! Water in my nose... Ack!"<br><br>The swordsmen came up with excuses, but Raon kept hitting their heads without mercy.<br><br>-Sigh...<br><br>Wrath let out an exasperated breath.<br><br>-This is just like whack-a-mole with moles coming up from the ground!<br><br>He trembled his lips, saying it was fun only for Raon but torture for the swordsmen.<br><br>'No, it's not.'<br><br>Raon calmly shook his head.<br><br>'It's killing three birds with one stone: increasing lung capacity, practicing swordsmanship, and building resistance to the sea and cold energy.'<br><br>-Wipe that smile off your face before you say such things!<br><br>Wrath gritted his teeth, saying even Angels wouldn't torture like this.<br><br>'Hmm...'<br><br>Raon lowered his raised corners of his mouth and looked at the sea right in front of him. Martha, unlike the others, was swinging her sword underwater without coming up even once, enduring patiently.<br><br>'...'<br><br>Raon clenched his fist as he felt the burning will rising in Martha's eyes.<br><br>'I must...'<br><br>Persuade the Holy Sword Alliance Leader, no matter what.<br><br>***<br><br>"The Dark Night Sword God is here?"<br><br>Raon let out a sigh as he surveyed the lavish scenery of the Kingdom of Oscott, which looked as if money had been smeared all over it.<br><br>'It doesn't suit him at all.'<br><br>He was surprised that the Dark Night Sword God Darkan, who seemed like he would only swing his sword in quiet places, was staying in the Kingdom of Oscott, which was full of entertainment.<br><br>-Why? What kind of place is this?<br><br>Wrath tilted his chin as if asking for an explanation.<br><br>'This place is different from ordinary kingdoms. The king is a gambler, and the entire royal capital is filled with gambling dens, alcohol, and drugs.'<br><br>While it wasn't quite a lawless zone beyond all control, Oscott was a land governed by money and violence rather than humanity and conscience.<br><br>'The Dark Night Sword God Darkan wasn't interested in money, gambling, or entertainment, but only in swords. I don't understand why he's here.'<br><br>While Darkan could easily devour this kingdom if he set his mind to it, it was strange that someone obsessed with swords would spend time in such a place.<br><br>"Yes. He's here."<br><br>Rector took the lead, heading up to the royal capital where red and blue lights flickered.<br><br>'I wonder what he's doing.'<br><br>Not knowing whether Darkan had fallen into alcohol, gambling, or women, he briefly licked his lips and followed behind Rector. However, Rector began to veer away from the city center, full of gambling dens and bars, and headed towards the outskirts.<br><br>The brilliant lights and thick smell of money disappeared, replaced by a musty stench and filth underfoot.<br><br>"Grandfather?"<br><br>Raon widened his eyes as he called out to Rector, who was entering a narrow, dark alley.<br><br>"Is the Dark Night Sword God really here?"<br><br>"He's right there."<br><br>Rector raised his hand, saying they had arrived. At the end of his finger was a man kneeling in front of a dilapidated gambling den.<br><br>"Please, just one coin..."<br><br>The man with a black eyepatch covering both eyes was raising his trembling hand with a voice drained of all strength.<br><br>"Get lost!"<br><br>"Won't you leave?"<br><br>Young thugs who seemed to have just come out of the gambling den stomped on the blind beggar and spat on his head.<br><br>"The water's not good here anymore."<br><br>They threw a single silver coin at the beggar's feet and disappeared, cackling among themselves.<br><br>"Th-Thank you."<br><br>The blind beggar picked up the silver coin that had fallen to the ground in one try, as if he could see.<br><br>'Haa...'<br><br>Raon swallowed hard as he looked at the beggar with the same face as Darkan he had seen at the Holy Sword Alliance's Holy Ground.<br><br>'That crazy bastard!'<br><br>What the hell is he doing begging here!</p>
