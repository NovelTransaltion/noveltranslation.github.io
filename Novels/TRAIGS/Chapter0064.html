        <h3 class="my-5">Chapter 64</h3>
        <p>Martha Zieghart was thinking about Raon’s instruction as she ran ahead.<br><br>“You aren’t good at dealing with the defensive sword formation. It’s best to change your opponent.”<br><br>‘I’ll never do that!’<br><br>She swore immediately as he told her to run away from her opponents. Raon wasn’t surprised, nodding as if he knew she would say that.<br><br>“Then I’ll give you different instructions. Break the sword formation.”<br><br>“The sword formation?”<br><br>“The opponent’s sword formation isn’t perfect. No, it can’t be perfect since they are just trainees.”<br><br>“In what way are they not perfect?”<br><br>“They stopped you by gathering nine people’s auras together. Which means that the aura has moved within the sword formation.”<br><br>“Which means…”<br><br>“That’s right. If you aim for that moment, you can break the sword formation in your current state, even when you’ve already spent a lot of your aura.”<br><br>Chills ran down her spine upon hearing that.<br><br>‘What is that guy?’<br><br>Despite having just been sitting there, he noticed the enemy’s weaknesses and told her how to defeat them. He really looked like a monster.<br><br>“Rather than weakness, I want to win against them head on.”<br><br>Since she didn’t want to get overwhelmed by Raon’s words, she spoke without thinking.<br><br>“Yes. You can win against them after recovering your strength and aura, since you are outstanding. However, do you think you can do it right now?”<br><br>She obviously wasn’t able to respond. She couldn’t imagine herself winning against those high-stamina monsters in her current exhausted state.<br><br>“Like I said, this isn’t a one-on-one spar, but a team competition. Make your choice right now. Are you to choose your pride, resulting in an uncertain victory, or are you going to choose the team’s victory?”<br><br>Martha stood up in silence upon hearing that.<br><br>‘I would’ve ignored something like that before.’<br><br>Her arrogant self from before she lost to Raon would’ve kept fighting no matter what he told her.<br><br>However, she’d already experienced defeat once, and she could experience it a second time now. It was better to win no matter what, rather than losing.<br><br>‘His name was Dunn.’<br><br>She could see that Dunn guy that she’d fought before from afar. His rock-solid pressure was the same as before. She wanted to break through it with her fist, but she held herself back by gritting her teeth.<br><br>“Did you come back despite knowing that you can’t win against us? How stupid.”<br><br>“You’ll get hurt if you just say whatever you want.”<br><br>‘Just like me, before.’<br><br>Martha kicked off from the ground and dashed towards Dunn.<br><br>“Fourth formation!”<br><br>The trainees from behind came up next to him and gathered their aura.<br><br>“Hmph!”<br><br>Instead of striking the sword that she raised upwards, she spread her perception.<br><br>She could feel the sixth training ground trainees’ aura gathering around Dunn.<br><br>‘It’s really slow.’<br><br>It was just like Raon had said. Since they were dealing with a large amount of aura, the movement was as slow as a snail.<br><br>“Hmph!”<br><br>Martha inhaled heavily and turned to the right.<br><br>“Pointless!”<br><br>Dunn turned around and stood in front of her. It was the same development as before, but there was a difference.<br><br>Martha, who used to brainlessly swing her sword, pummeled her sword down at Dunn’s right flank, where the aura wasn’t gathered yet.<br><br> <br><br>Wham!<br><br> <br><br>The two swords clashed, creating a powerful wave.<br><br>Martha was pushed back by the impact, but Dunn and the trainees’ sword formation that used to be as solid as a deep-rooted tree also wavered significantly.<br><br>“Kuh!”<br><br>“Kuu…”<br><br>Dunn and the trainees groaned, then fixed the wavering sword formation.<br><br>Martha’s eyes shone like black pearls.<br><br>‘He was right!’<br><br>It was just like Raon had said. The place that the aura hadn’t gathered yet had a significantly weaker defense than the other places.<br><br>“This really was a breakthrough.”<br><br>Martha smirked.<br><br>Was it because the breakthrough was too easy?<br><br>It wasn’t. Raon Zieghart had noticed the sword formation’s weakness, sitting at the foothold with the flag. It was because she was frightened by his monstrosity.<br><br>“Don’t be arrogant just because you’ve come out ahead once!”<br><br>“Once? Stop making me laugh! It’s every time from now on!”<br><br>Martha pounced with a battle cry.<br><br>She moved to the left while pretending to attack, then she swung her sword towards Dunn’s lower body, where the aura didn’t move in time.<br><br> <br><br>Wham!<br><br> <br><br>Dunn quickly swung his sword in response, but his upper body wavered significantly and the trainees in the sword formation bounced out of formation.<br><br>“It’s over now!”<br><br>Emanating a beast-like pressure, Martha pounced at Dunn.<br><br> <br><br>* * *<br><br> <br><br>Burren spun the wrist holding his sword and raised his head.<br><br>Decal, who was one of the best collateral trainees, was glaring fiercely at him.<br><br>‘I lost against him before.’<br><br>Decal and the seven trainees attacked him at once, and since they’d used the ‘Intuition Sword’ that countered his swordsmanship, he couldn’t find any way of winning.<br><br>The other guys couldn’t help him either because of the difference in numbers, so he kept getting pushed back.<br><br>They weren’t lying when they said they had thoroughly planned in preparation to defeat the fifth training ground.<br><br>‘I’m not going to lose like before.’<br><br>Retreating once was enough. He was going to beat them all up, even if he had to collapse as a result.<br><br>“For the famous Burren Zieghart to run away, I guess numbers really do decide the battle.”<br><br>Decal grinned.<br><br>“Please, fight us until the end like a real swordsman this time!”<br><br>At his signal, the trainees behind him rushed at him like a plague of rats.<br><br>“Haa!”<br><br>Decal himself penetrated at the center, swinging his sword.<br><br>The eight people’s swords weren’t in harmony, but every single one of them were aimed at a weakness.<br><br>“Huff!”<br><br>Burren gathered his aura to use his footwork. Moving to the side like flowing water, he used the ‘Phenomenal Sword’.<br><br>His sword was bent towards Decal on his right side.<br><br>“Do it now!”<br><br>“Attack him at once!”<br><br>The moment Burren started his attack, the trainees that learned the ‘Intuition Sword’ rushed at him.<br><br>However, that was a trap laid down by Burren.<br><br> <br><br>Wham!<br><br> <br><br>The training sword that was aimed at Decal curved like a crescent moon and hit the wrists and chests of the trainees that were coming at him.<br><br>“Kuh!”<br><br>“Argh!”<br><br>In the blink of an eye, two trainees were rolling on the ground, grabbing their wrists and chests. Their conditions were so bad, it was safe to consider them eliminated.<br><br>“Hmph!”<br><br>Burren didn’t stop swinging his sword. Using the River Footwork, he kept moving and swung the ‘Phenomenal Sword’.<br><br>Because his large motion used his entire shoulder, the three trainees instinctively counterattacked, aiming for that opening.<br><br>‘Get baited.’<br><br>Burren’s blue eyes sparkled. Bending his elbow naturally, he stuck the incoming trainees’ chest without reservation.<br><br> <br><br>Whack!<br><br> <br><br>Three trainees were sent away flying in a single strike.<br><br>“Kuh!”<br><br>“Ugh…”<br><br>The one that was hit at the end managed to stand back up, but the other two had already fainted.<br><br>“D-damn it!”<br><br>Decal chased him, but it was too late since Burren had already stepped aside.<br><br>“Wh-what happened?! Why are you suddenly mixing in feints?!”<br><br>“That’s what I’m saying.”<br><br>Burren frowned.<br><br>‘How can it change this much from just mixing in feints?’<br><br>‘Intuition Sword’ was a swordsmanship that relied on instinct instead of being systematic. The trainees that were still immature had no choice but to splash around, baited by the feints.<br><br>‘But how did he even realize that?’<br><br>He was certain Raon didn’t move from that place. The perception and knowledge of the guy that observed the entire situation from his seat gave him goosebumps.<br><br>‘Martha must be feeling the same way right now.’<br><br>He was sure that Martha, who was fighting further down, must’ve been thinking the same thing.<br><br>‘He’s like an onion.’<br><br>Raon showed him another side of himself just when he thought he finally understood him. Just like an onion, new layers kept coming out upon peeling him open.<br><br>“It’s not over yet!”<br><br>“Haaa!”<br><br>Decan dashed at him, gritting his teeth. The three other trainees did the same.<br><br> <br><br>Whoosh!<br><br> <br><br>Burren thrust his sword forward. It was a powerful strike, multiple openings could be seen in his big motion.<br><br>“It’s a feint. Don’t pay attention to it! Huh?”<br><br>Decal’s eyes were wide. He was planning to ignore it, but the trajectory of Burren’s sword didn’t change.<br><br>“It’s a real one this time!”<br><br>“N-no way!”<br><br>He tried to defend against it, but it was already too late.<br><br> <br><br>Wham!<br><br> <br><br>Taking the powerful strike, Decal’s training sword broke and his body was sent back flying.<br><br>“The fight is already over.”<br><br>Looking at the remaining trainees, Burren’s eyes glowed.<br><br>“It’s our victory.”<br><br>As long as that monster existed, there was no way the fifth training ground could lose.<br><br> <br><br>***<br><br> <br><br>“Wh-what is this?!”<br><br>Metun’s eyes were about to pop out of his head as he watched the sixth training ground trainees lose at the same time.<br><br>“What is happening?”<br><br>He could understand one side starting to lose. However, top, center, and bottom were all being pushed back at the same time against the opponents they’d won against.<br><br>“I told you already, the battle isn’t over yet.”<br><br>Rimmer, who was lying down next to him, murmured provokingly while yawning<br><br>“You must’ve done something!”<br><br>“I didn’t do anything, but Raon did.”<br><br>“What?”<br><br>“Before you came to watch, Raon gave them advice. And that worked.”<br><br>“Are you saying a mere trainee’s advice changed the situation this much?”<br><br>“It’s because he’s not a mere trainee. He’s Raon.”<br><br>Rimmer smirked and pointed at Raon, who was protecting the flag on his own.<br><br>“Some trainees don’t follow him, and some dislike him. However, they all trust his power and decision making. I think they’ll start following his words like a god’s voice.”<br><br>“Hmm…”<br><br>Metun groaned. That meant he was trusted by the others.<br><br>However, rather than the fact that he was trusted, the way his advice significantly changed the tide of the battle was more surprising.<br><br>“What was the advice?”<br><br>“Are you curious? If you are, then give me the gold… Ah, alright.”<br><br>Rimmer waved his hand, noticing Metun’s stiffened expression.<br><br>“Firstly, about the top…”<br><br>He told Metun about the advice Raon gave the trainees.<br><br>“That’s crazy…”<br><br>Metun’s fingers trembled.<br><br>‘How can a trainee give such advice?’<br><br>It was a perfect walkthrough, without a single flaw.<br><br>However, what was more surprising was the fact that he’d noticed all those weaknesses by only using his perception.<br><br>Rimmer was correct. The arrogant one wasn’t Raon, but himself.<br><br>He deserved the praise of having a better perception than Kein.<br><br>‘However.’<br><br>Watching Kein, who had started his move, Metun smiled confidently.<br><br>‘The match isn’t over yet.’<br><br> <br><br>***<br><br> <br><br>Raon, who was sitting under the flag, opened his eyes.<br><br>‘They are all doing pretty well.’<br><br>While hiding his presence, he released his fully opened perception in order to observe the status of the battle. He smiled.<br><br>Burren, who managed to defeat Decal, stormed through the trainees that had learned the ‘Intuition Sword’, and Martha was beating up the remaining trainees after breaking through the sword formation.<br><br>And Runaan…<br><br>She was having an icy competition against the sixth training ground’s better trainee, who came out to be her opponent.<br><br>‘Well, it doesn’t matter.’<br><br>Since it looked like she wasn’t going to lose, it was going to be fine.<br><br>‘Well, then…’<br><br>Raon stood up. As he warmed himself up, the bushes swayed and a blond, blue-eyed swordsman appeared.<br><br>‘Kein Zieghart.’<br><br>The sixth training ground’s top trainee, and the member of the direct line that was two years older than him, had appeared.<br><br>‘I knew it.’<br><br>Since they were losing in every direction, and Raon himself was hiding his presence, there was only one thing he could do.<br><br>Seize the opponent’s flag.<br><br>“So you were here, Raon Zieghart.”<br><br>Kein bit his lip. He didn’t look surprised, as he must’ve been expecting it.<br><br>“I didn’t expect you to cast magic on the trainees. I heard you weren’t acknowledged by them, but it must’ve been a false rumor.”<br><br>He slowly drew his sword from around his waist.<br><br>“However, this is the end.”<br><br>“The end?”<br><br>“I heard your aura has a fire attribute.”<br><br>As he said that, a crimson flame flared up on his blade.<br><br>“Unfortunately, my aura is the highest tier fire attribute aura, and I have more aura than a regular swordsman. In this match up, you can’t win against me.”<br><br>“Match up, huh?”<br><br>Raon smirked and unsheathed his sword. The energy from the ‘Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation’ created a red flower as it heated up the blade.<br><br> <br><br>Whir!<br><br> <br><br>It was a lot smaller than the fire on Kein’s sword, but the color was incomparably denser.<br><br>“People from this house really talk a lot before fighting.”<br><br>Raon declared, eyes the same color as the flame.<br><br>“Come at me. I’ll show you how a single flower of flame can engulf your fire.”</p>
