        <p>Tsk. Raon clicked his tongue briefly as he observed the grayish aura obtained from Rage.<br><br>'It's not a large amount.'<br><br>The aura obtained from the black-haired, black-eyed man wasn't very substantial, as if Wrath had taken most of the power.<br><br>'However...'<br><br>The quality is exceptionally high. Although the black-haired, black-eyed man had already disappeared, making it unclear what abilities this grayish aura possessed, it was certain that it held tremendous power.<br><br>'It would be best to convert it to Glacier.'<br><br>The aura left by the black-haired, black-eyed demon wasn't Cold Energy. Although it could be transformed into Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation, it seemed better to fill the relatively lacking Glacier. With a resonating hum, Raon operated Glacier at its extreme to absorb the grayish aura left by the black-haired, black-eyed demon.<br><br>'It's completely different from the Cold Energy I've obtained until now.'<br><br>He bit his lip as he felt the movement of the grayish aura, which was raging as if it would break through his mana circuit.<br><br>'It's resisting fiercely, like a beast with a leash around its neck.'<br><br>The Cold Energy he had obtained on his way here had become his aura and accumulated in his energy center the moment he operated Glacier, but the aura left by the black-haired, black-eyed man was fiercely resisting within his mana circuit as if it would never become his own.<br><br>'I don't understand why it's causing such a commotion when I didn't even forcibly take it.'<br><br>In truth, it didn't matter what he did. Glacier was a cultivation technique that Wrath had created himself and was still using. Because it was the power of a top-tier demon king, no matter how strong the aura left by the black-haired, black-eyed man was, it would ultimately be absorbed.<br><br>'I might be a bit of a bad guy, but...'<br><br>Thinking that it couldn't be helped for the greater good, he forcibly controlled the grayish aura using the magnificent Cold Energy of Glacier.<br><br>'It's starting to stabilize now.'<br><br>The aura left by the black-haired, black-eyed man, overwhelmed by the powerful Cold Energy, began to seep into his energy center following the flow of Glacier.<br><br>'Now that I've controlled the grayish aura, shall I look for Wrath?'<br><br>Certain that Wrath had fought with the black-haired, black-eyed man in this space, he looked around for traces of him.<br><br>‘There are many traces of the decisive battle.’<br><br>Seeing the remnants of powerful techniques like Silver Aurora scattered around, it seemed Wrath had fought with all his might.<br><br>'That guy from earlier...'<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he looked at the dust remaining where the black-haired, black-eyed man had died.<br><br>'Was he that strong?'<br><br>He had subdued him immediately because he looked dangerous and only extracted his aura, but if he had known it would be like this, he should have gathered some information.<br><br>'No, it probably wouldn't have mattered much.'<br><br>This space was created based on Wrath's memories. Since that guy had sprung from his memories, there probably wasn't much to learn even if he had asked.<br><br>'But I can't see a way to the next level.'<br><br>Is he still taking the test? It seemed that Wrath was also undergoing the final test in a place separate from here, just like when he had obtained the power of the golden sun.<br><br>'Then it would be better to wait here.'<br><br>Rather than returning to the exit, it seemed better to stay here until Wrath came back. Raon sat down on the scorched ground, leaning his back against the frozen World Tree.<br><br>'I don't need to obtain any more aura than this, so it would be perfect to practice cultivation.'<br><br>He had gained unexpectedly many rewards while chasing after Wrath. Since he hadn't fully absorbed the aura received from the black-haired, black-eyed man, it seemed good to practice cultivation here. In fact, before coming here, he had considered taking a little—no, a very little—of Wrath's reward, but now it wasn't necessary.<br><br>'Overeating can make your stomach burst. And...'<br><br>Wrath also needed to recover his strength. Although it would be quite troublesome if Wrath became stronger, he had received so much help from him that he wanted to see him smile arrogantly.<br><br>'Since it's come to this, come back stronger.'<br><br>Because I'll grow more too. Raon briefly licked his lips and closed his eyes. The gray aura emanating from his shoulders slowly began to turn silver.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>"I heard Raon entered the Room of Self?"<br><br>Alice leaned against the door of the audience chamber, wiggling her finger.<br><br>"You keep saying 'our nephew, our nephew,' but you didn't even know that?"<br><br>Glenn snorted, grumbling that she was all talk.<br><br>"Living in the mountains, I forgot."<br><br>Alice clicked her tongue grumpily, saying she had forgotten.<br><br>"You went up to the mountains? Again?"<br><br>"Seeing Raon and Karoon fight, I couldn't hold back."<br><br>She clenched her fist, saying that when she saw the duel between the two, her blood boiled and she couldn't just sit still.<br><br>"I understand what you mean."<br><br>Glenn nodded calmly.<br><br>'Both Raon and Karoon poured the beliefs they've built up since childhood into their swords.'<br><br>Karoon held onto his affection and nobility for Zieghart, while Raon ascended to Transcendence with the unyielding sword he had committed to from the moment he declared he would elevate Sylvia to the Direct Lineage. It was natural for the hearts of those watching to ignite as these Transcendent swords, each imbued with different willpower, clashed.<br><br>"So I'm going to start again."<br><br>Alice exhaled calmly and thumped her chest with her fist.<br><br>"You mean you've finished preparing your body and mind?"<br><br>Glenn narrowed his eyes as he examined Alice.<br><br>"It's not perfect."<br><br>Alice frowned as she looked at her slightly trembling fingertips.<br><br>"But I've raised it to about 80 percent."<br><br>She licked her lips, saying she was almost ready to accept the mana from the Dragon Heart.<br><br>"I see. It's evident that you've prepared diligently."<br><br>Glenn nodded as he looked into Alice's calm eyes.<br><br>"In the past, you would have just prepared your body roughly and then accepted the mana from the Dragon Heart. You've changed a lot. Probably because of Raon."<br><br>He muttered that it was amazing and let out a thin smile.<br><br>"That's right. It's because of Raon."<br><br>Alice nodded without the slightest hesitation.<br><br>"My beloved nephew gave me a treasure he obtained after overcoming a near-death experience, without asking for anything in return. I can't waste it meaninglessly."<br><br>She bit her lip, saying she would absorb all the mana inside the Dragon Heart even if she had to chew it to the bone.<br><br>"You've thought well."<br><br>Glenn calmly closed and opened his eyes, saying that was obviously the right thing to do.<br><br>"But do you know? That you've changed a lot too, Father?"<br><br>Alice looked up slightly at Glenn.<br><br>"Me?"<br><br>Glenn lowered his eyebrows as if to ask what she meant.<br><br>"The old you would never have told me that I prepared diligently."<br><br>She frowned, saying he would have just gestured for her to leave without saying a word.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Glenn briefly licked his lips, his eyes lowered.<br><br>"You're not wrong."<br><br>When he was immersed in demonic energy, he had no interest in even his son and daughter, let alone his grandchildren. It was a time when he only thought about his own strength, so Alice's words were not incorrect.<br><br>"Your change is also thanks to Raon, right? He's really a bundle of fortune."<br><br>Alice attributed her own change to Raon's influence and gave a subtle smile.<br><br>"Ahem! It's not just because of R-Raon, but thanks to all the children!"<br><br>Glenn shook his head, seemingly embarrassed, saying that he was able to change not just because of Raon, but thanks to all the children.<br><br>"Whatever the case, it's good. Much better than when you were surrounded by ice."<br><br>Alice nodded, saying she liked his current self.<br><br>"I wonder if our nephew is doing well?"<br><br>She looked at the door on the right leading to the Room of Self with worried eyes.<br><br>"What did you see in the Room of Self?"<br><br>Glenn shook his head as he looked at the door, following Alice's gaze.<br><br>“I was in an underwater arena, constantly fighting. It was fun, with endless interesting opponents.”<br><br>Alice let out a long laugh, saying she wanted to enter the Room of Self again.<br><br>"Then there's no need to worry."<br><br>Glenn calmly shook his head.<br><br>"There's no way Raon won't be able to walk the path you've passed."<br><br>He smirked, saying there was no need for worry.<br><br>"I know that! Can't I just worry a little!"<br><br>Alice snorted defiantly.<br><br>"Now, tell me the reason you came."<br><br>Glenn briefly licked his lips and placed his hand on the armrest of the throne.<br><br>"Don't waste time with other stories."<br><br>He tilted his chin as if telling her to get to the point.<br><br>"You knew?"<br><br>Alice's eyes trembled slightly.<br><br>"Because you're someone who shows it on your face."<br><br>Glenn nodded, saying he could see it all.<br><br>"Phew, you really have changed a lot."<br><br>Alice let out a heavy sigh, saying she might as well speak since it had come to this. She looked up at Glenn with her hands clasped in front of her.<br><br>"Please help me a little."<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>The moon, which had been emitting silver frost as if to freeze the world, was falling closer and closer to Wrath. Just as Wrath was about to receive the silver moon's frost with his entire body, a black crack appeared before him, as if blocking his path. A deep rumble resonated.<br><br>The pitch-black crack erased the Cold Energy pouring from the moonlight, as if telling Wrath that it would not allow him any more power.<br><br>Tsk. Wrath opened his eyes sluggishly, as if frustrated. He clicked his tongue briefly as he looked at the enormous moon still glowing blue.<br><br>"As expected, there's a limit."<br><br>When he entered the State of Enlightenment and tried to accept all the frost from the silver moon, the black crack appeared and cut off the path connecting him to the moon. As he had felt when first coming here, it seemed that a limit was placed on the power he could obtain due to two souls entering.<br><br>'I knew it, but it's disappointing.'<br><br>If he had come alone, he might have been able to break through the barrier. If he had accepted all the power of that moonlight, he could have not only recovered his lost strength but possibly ascended to the next level. It was frustrating that he couldn't climb the final step.<br><br>He had expected there would be a limit to the power from the beginning, but actually missing a new level right before his eyes was frustratingly disappointing. To the point where he almost resented Raon who had entered with him.<br><br>'No. There's absolutely no need to resent him.'<br><br>If it weren't for Raon, it would have been impossible for him to enter this place at all. He should be grateful, not resentful.<br><br>'No, no! There's no reason not to resent him either!'<br><br>There was no need to view favorably that weasel who threatened him with Nadine bread every day. If he had met him here, he would have definitely thrown a punch.<br><br>'Threatening with food is the ugliest thing in the world!'<br><br>Honestly, eating Nadine bread was more infuriating than giving Raon stats and traits.<br><br>'Moreover...'<br><br>It's not difficult to eat Bead Ice Cream and delicious food! Raon is rich enough to spend money like water. He doesn't understand why someone who has accumulated more money than he could spend in a lifetime is so frugal. His hands trembled with anger every time Raon ate cheap food, claiming he had no money.<br><br>'However, since he definitely created an opportunity for me to recover, I'll let it slide this time.'<br><br>Thanks to Raon, he had recovered a considerable level of Authority and realm of the soul, if not his original power, so he decided to forgive him just this once.<br><br>"Phew..."<br><br>Wrath let out a long sigh as he looked at the blue moon separated from the space where he stood.<br><br>'It's regrettable, but I should go back now.'<br><br>Although it was disappointing that he couldn't absorb all that energy, he couldn't stay here forever. It was time to return. As soon as he thought about going back, a circular Dimensional Gate made of blue flames opened, just like when he first entered this place.<br><br>"It would be nice if I could come here again."<br><br>Wrath looked at the moon emitting a vivid blue light as if bidding it farewell, then exited through the Dimensional Gate. The sensation of his body floating returned. However, the Cold Energy he had obtained from the moonlight began to slowly flow elsewhere.<br><br>'W-What is this now?'<br><br>It was the first time his Cold Energy moved beyond his control. He opened his eyes in confusion, but could only see darkness.<br><br>'How frustrating.'<br><br>It wasn't a large amount of energy. Though it might be considered trivial, it felt unpleasant that something of his was being drawn away somewhere.<br><br>'I hope I arrive as quickly as possible...'<br><br>As Wrath was stomping his feet in mid-air while biting his lip, he felt the sensation of his toes touching the ground. When he opened his eyes, he saw the Snowfield where he had fought with Rage.<br><br>'Surely here... Huh?'<br><br>Why is that Raon here? Raon, whom he hadn't expected, was leaning against the World Tree with his eyes closed. As he tilted his head in confusion, he saw his blue Cold Energy flowing from his heart towards Raon.<br><br>"You again! You bundle of greed!"<br><br>He grinded his teeth audibly as he looked at Raon.<br><br>'This won't do. If I leave him like this...'<br><br>I'll lose all the power I've barely gained! A bright red killing intent flared up in Wrath's blue eyes.<br><br>'I must protect this at all costs!'<br><br>Even if I have to punch that devil!<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>"Hmm?"<br><br>Raon opened his eyes with furrowed brows. While he was absorbing the grayish aura, a high-purity Cold Energy from somewhere was assisting his cultivation.<br><br>'What is this...'<br><br>Not knowing what was happening, he turned his head and saw Wrath standing to his right.<br><br>"Is it over now?"<br><br>Unlike his expectation, it wasn't in the form of cotton candy. It was the original form, neither clearly male nor female, but he had seen it several times before, so he didn't feel particularly repulsed.<br><br>"You again!"<br><br>Wrath gritted his teeth as he looked at him. He was trembling all over as if extremely angry.<br><br>"Uh...?"<br><br>Raon's eyes widened as he looked at Wrath.<br><br>"What are you suddenly talking about?"<br><br>He had just been waiting for Wrath, so he didn't understand what "you again" meant.<br><br>"Not content with controlling my meals, now you're devouring the power I gained here too!"<br><br>"No, I only took what you left behind..."<br><br>Raon waved both hands quickly. He had only taken the remnants of what Wrath had gained and left behind, so he was bewildered by Wrath's anger.<br><br>"I had been harboring some gratitude towards you. But!"<br><br>Wrath raised a terrifying Authority of Wrath over his blue eyes, as if truly enraged.<br><br>"I cannot stand by and watch you steal even the power I gained here! I'll correct that filthy habit of yours!"<br><br>He emitted such a powerful aura that it felt like Raon's heart was sinking.<br><br>"You enemy of Nadine bread!"<br><br>"W-Why am I the enemy of Nadine bread?"<br><br>Raon blinked. Being called the enemy of Nadine bread was even more confusing than Wrath's anger.<br><br>"Didn't you feed me Nadine bread every single day!"<br><br>"Then I'm not the enemy. The word enemy means..."<br><br>“Shut that devil’s mouth!”<br><br>As he tried to explain the word "enemy," his vision suddenly changed. The world spun rapidly, and he saw his own body standing on the ground.<br><br>'Why is my body... Gasp!'<br><br>Raon's jaw dropped as he saw his own body crumbling, having lost its head.<br><br>'Did I just die?'<br><br>By Wrath? As his mind went blank with disbelief, he heard Wrath's flustered voice.<br><br>"D-Damn it all! I used my full power in anger!"<br><br>He wailed that he couldn't control the power he had gained after so long.<br><br>'That crazy demon king...'<br><br>Raon gritted his teeth inwardly as he watched the world grow dark.<br><br>'He definitely did that on purpose!'</p>
