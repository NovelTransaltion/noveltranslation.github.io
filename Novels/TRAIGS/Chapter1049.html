        <p>Raon lowered his eyes and then opened them before leaving the annex. The maids were starting their daily routines with chatter, and the sound of Sia swinging her sword could be heard from the lakeside.<br><br>Enjoying the sounds of the annex that always lifted his mood, he headed towards the lake. Sylvia and Edgar had set up a table behind the lake, watching Sia hone her swordsmanship.<br><br>"It's unusual for you to stay this late and have breakfast with us," <br><br>Sylvia remarked, setting down her teacup as she looked at him.<br><br>"Aren't you going to the training ground today?"<br><br>She smiled faintly, as if it was a rare occurrence.<br><br>-The breakfast was indeed good today.<br><br>Wrath relaxed his eyes and licked his lips.<br><br>-The lightly seared meat melted softly in my mouth with the wine. It was a good palate cleanser before the grilled Kraken.<br><br>He nodded, satisfied with the meal before the battle.<br><br>"The intensive training period ended yesterday," <br><br>Edgar pointed to the piercingly blue sky with his finger.<br><br>"Our son deserves a day off too."<br><br>He gently patted Raon's arm, saying he should rest well today after all his hard work.<br><br>"Would you like some tea?"<br><br>Edgar pulled out a chair next to him and gestured for Raon to sit.<br><br>"I have something to tell you both."<br><br>Raon sat down in the chair Edgar had pulled out and let out a soft sigh. The two put down their teacups and turned their attention to him.<br><br>"Do you remember the story from about three months ago, when Light Wind and I caught an apostle and sank the White Blood Religion's ship?"<br><br>He brought up the details of the mission from three months ago before getting into the main point.<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>"Certainly, I remember. I could recite every word you said without missing a single detail!"<br><br>Sylvia nodded as if it were obvious, while Edgar muttered about the atmosphere at the time, seeming to truly remember everything.<br><br>"Actually, that story didn't end with killing the apostle. The sea spirit I saved told me the location of the White Blood Religion's headquarters, and I, along with Evelyn and Roenn..."<br><br>Raon told them everything that had happened since then.<br><br>"I see."<br><br>"No wonder you've been so busy..."<br><br>However, Sylvia and Edgar accepted it calmly, as if they had known about all his activities.<br><br>"So you already knew?"<br><br>When he left with Rector and when he recently went to the sea alone, Sylvia and Edgar hadn't asked anything, so he had somewhat expected it. It seemed they had been reading his movements and predicting the war with the White Blood Religion.<br><br>"Don't underestimate your mother, dear."<br><br>Sylvia waved her hand, saying she could sense things without being told.<br><br>"I know you better than anyone in the world."<br><br>She smiled softly, saying his thoughts were transparent to her.<br><br>"It's not just you; I sensed something from our father's reaction too."<br><br>Edgar raised his eyebrows, resting his chin on the table.<br><br>"That man can't lie well."<br><br>He snorted, saying he had sensed it from Rector, not himself.<br><br>"I see."<br><br>Raon nodded with a faint smile.<br><br>"Are you confident you can win?"<br><br>Sylvia met his eyes. In the past, she would have been on the verge of tears from excessive worry, but now she was barely holding herself together, her hands trembling. It seemed she didn't want to show weakness to him as he was participating in the war.<br><br>"I've prepared to the point where I won't have any regrets. Now all that's left is..."<br><br>Raon drank the tea Edgar had poured in one gulp and stood up from the chair.<br><br>"To do my best."<br><br>He bowed to them, saying he would be back.<br><br>"Raon."<br><br>Sia approached the table, having heard he was leaving.<br><br>"Are you going to fight?"<br><br>"Yes. There are some bad guys I need to teach a lesson."<br><br>"Can't I go too?"<br><br>She hugged the sword he had given her preciously, as if she wanted to go with him.<br><br>"You have your own place to fight, sister."<br><br>Sia was already strong, but she was growing faster than anyone else. She could make a significant contribution if she participated in the war right now.<br><br>However, the first enemy she should draw her sword against wasn't the White Blood Religion, but Eden. She needed to thrust her blade of revenge into those who had insulted and mocked Edgar and herself, no, their entire family.<br><br>"Can you wait until then?"<br><br>"Of course!"<br><br>Sia nodded as if to say not to worry, then returned to the lake and swung her sword.<br><br>"That child has grown a lot too."<br><br>Sylvia sighed, seeming both proud and a bit regretful.<br><br>"She's pass her rebellious phase. Soon, she'll be more mature than me."<br><br>Raon laughed, saying the days of treating Sia like a little sister were numbered.<br><br>"S-Sia's rebellious phase is over?" <br><br>Edgar's eyes widened in surprise.<br><br>"She still won't let me into her room! She does her laundry separately and won't sleep with us!"<br><br>He raised his chin as if to ask why.<br><br>"..."<br><br>"..."<br><br>Raon and Sylvia stared blankly at Edgar without saying a word.<br><br>"She still won't eat the side dishes I pass to her and throws them away! Why is she doing this?"<br><br>Edgar clutched his head, saying he didn't understand at all.<br><br>-Why, you ask...<br><br>Wrath snorted as he watched Edgar wail.<br><br>-That's because she hates it!<br><br>***<br><br>In the Sacrifice Chamber, where red and white blood flowed together. Blood Demons approached the martial artists who were bound with their eyeballs plucked out. The Blood Demons breathed heavily, seemingly struggling to control their appetite as they watched the blood flowing from the martial artists' eye sockets.<br><br>"Eat."<br><br>As the blue-haired handsome man flicked his finger, the Blood Demons unleashed their suppressed desires and bit into the martial artists' necks.<br><br>"Aaaaargh!"<br><br>"Aaaaagh!"<br><br>The martial artists screamed as if their throats were being torn apart, but the Blood Demons became more excited by the sound and tore off flesh with their sharp fangs. The screams of people begging them to stop were merely an orchestra in a high-class restaurant, enhancing the Blood Demons' appetite.<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion, watching this scene, lowered her pipe and exhaled white smoke through her red lips.<br><br>"You've done well to gather such prey in such a short time."<br><br>She nodded slightly towards the blue-haired handsome man approaching her.<br><br>"12th Apostle."<br><br>"It's all thanks to your holy teachings, Leader."<br><br>The man called the 12th Apostle carefully bowed with his hand on his chest.<br><br>"You still know how to use that tongue of yours well."<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion snorted at the smiling 12th Apostle.<br><br>"I thought you'd spend your whole life just wagging that mouth of yours, but to think you'd reach Transcendence."<br><br>She lowered her eyebrows as if genuinely surprised.<br><br>"I can't even calculate how many sacrifices you must have skimmed off along the way."<br><br>"Ahahahaha."<br><br>The 12th Apostle awkwardly laughed and rubbed the back of his neck as if embarrassed.<br><br>"I'm sorry. I got a bit greedy after being inspired by your teachings, Leader."<br><br>He slightly lowered his eyes as if he couldn't deceive the Leader of the White Blood Religion.<br><br>"Normally, that body would have burst before reaching Transcendence. Be grateful for your sturdy frame."<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion waved her hand as if to say it was fine.<br><br>"Thank you for understanding. Though it's meager as a repayment..."<br><br>The 12th Apostle extended his hand with a subtle smile.<br><br>"I've brought a gift for you, Leader."<br><br>As he flicked his finger, the red-haired Archbishop brought in a woman who was blindfolded, gagged, and bound.<br><br>"This is the Captain of the Royal Guard of the Sebion Kingdom. A Grandmaster."<br><br>The 12th Apostle spread his arms as if to say he hadn't inflicted a single wound, so she could enjoy as she pleased.<br><br>"I hope this prey becomes the final piece for your great work, Leader."<br><br>"You sly fox."<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion curled her lips, seemingly not entirely displeased despite her words.<br><br>"If you and the 10th Apostle were mixed half and half, you'd have made quite a decent man."<br><br>She clicked her tongue, looking at the 10th Apostle standing silently to her right.<br><br>"To be compared to such a great senior in that way, it's an honor."<br><br>The 12th Apostle bowed his head towards the 10th Apostle.<br><br>"..."<br><br>The 10th Apostle merely glanced at the 12th Apostle and turned his gaze away without saying a word.<br><br>"How's the atmosphere outside?"<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion asked with the pipe between her lips.<br><br>"The Five Kings... no, the entire continent is quiet. However, I didn't sense peace. Should I say it's like a powder keg before ignition?"<br><br>The 12th Apostle licked his lips, saying he felt an anxiety as if it would burst at any moment.<br><br>"That means they're preparing to strike at us."<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion exhaled white smoke, saying the Five Kings' thoughts were transparent.<br><br>"Come to think of it, it seems it's time for you to change bodies."<br><br>The 12th Apostle narrowed his eyes, looking at the white scales that had appeared on the back of the Leader of the White Blood Religion's hand.<br><br>"It reminds me of when I brought that body."<br><br>He shrugged, looking at the 10th Apostle.<br><br>"I was about to eat it, but senior stopped me. Thanks to that, we have our current Leader."<br><br>The 12th Apostle applauded the 10th Apostle, saying he had done a great thing.<br><br>"..."<br><br>The 10th Apostle didn't react to the 12th Apostle's words, which seemed like both praise and mockery, and just stared straight ahead.<br><br>"A change..."<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion frowned, looking at the scales on the back of her hand.<br><br>"I should certainly make preparations."<br><br>She nodded slightly towards the 10th Apostle.<br><br>"Contact the thirteenth."<br><br>With those final words, the Leader of the White Blood Religion left the Sacrifice Chamber, taking the Captain of the Royal Guard of the Sebion Kingdom that the 12th Apostle had procured.<br><br>"Even though I've reached Transcendence, it seems the Leader trusts senior more. How disappointing."<br><br>The 12th Apostle clicked his tongue as if regretful, then followed the Leader of the White Blood Religion outside.<br><br>"The thirteenth..."<br><br>The 10th Apostle slowly parted his lips, not turning his eyes away from the people dying with all the blood drained from their bodies.<br><br>***<br><br>Raon climbed onto the platform of the fifth training ground with heavy steps.<br><br>"Everyone has worked hard."<br><br>He surveyed the swordsmen who had followed his grueling training for the long yet short two months. He nodded with satisfaction at his subordinates who had grown both physically and mentally.<br><br>"This operation to attack the White Blood Religion has been progressed with only a select few in Zieghart knowing about it, which means we will be playing a leading role in this war."<br><br>Raon lowered his red gaze to the swordsmen who were emitting rough martial will as if excited.<br><br>"It means we must produce results, even if we have to pour out all our efforts and everything we've built up so far. Can you do it?"<br><br>He stepped on the platform with the weight of ten thousand catties, saying that if they couldn't or weren't confident, they should drop out now.<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>Burren struck his chest with his fist, uttering in an unwavering voice.<br><br>"I'm ready too..."<br><br>A starlight of determination flashed in Runaan's dull eyes.<br><br>"I-I'm scared, but I'll fight to the end. No, I'll succeed!"<br><br>Dorian clenched his fist, saying he would fight with his life on the line even though he hadn't completely overcome his fear.<br><br>"I'll fight like a madman, just like our crazy Palace Master!"<br><br>Krein repeatedly called him a madman as if rebelling against him again, but Raon let it slide for now because he liked the spirit.<br><br>"I will follow."<br><br>"Finally, a real battle with the Five Demons. I'm looking forward to it."<br><br>Mark Goetun simply bowed, saying he would follow, while Trevin clashed his fists together, saying he had been waiting for this moment.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Martha, who always roared at the forefront, didn't open her mouth but gripped her sword so tightly that veins popped up on the back of her hand. That alone was enough to answer how she was approaching this war.<br><br>"Let's go."<br><br>Raon descended from the platform with calmly settled eyes and headed towards the exit of the training ground. The Light Wind Palace swordsmen followed behind him, emitting sharp martial will as if they had already drawn their swords. Raon led the swordsmen, who had become like a single sharp blade, into the Head of House's training ground.<br><br>The Head of House's training ground was the largest place in Zieghart, but it was almost full with the martial forces lined up in response to Glenn's summons.<br><br>"Light Wind Palace, please come this way."<br><br>Raon followed Roenn's guidance, who was waiting, towards the left side where the palace was lining up.<br><br>"Wait for my instructions."<br><br>After instructing the Light Wind Palace swordsmen not to move, he went to the front of the platform where the executives were standing.<br><br>"Hey! Nephew!"<br><br>"You're here."<br><br>Balder and Denier, who had arrived earlier, waved at him.<br><br>'Denier.'<br><br>Although it was still unclear whether Denier was an ally or an enemy, he emitted a stench similar to Derus Robert. He must never let his guard down and remain cautious until the end.<br><br>"I greet the two Palace Masters."<br><br>"You're late."<br><br>As Raon bowed to Denier and Balder, Karoon walked out from the far left.<br><br>"Raon! It's been a while! I heard you took good care of our kids!"<br><br>Alice popped out from behind Karoon and ran towards him.<br><br>'What...'<br><br>Raon let out a sigh as he looked at Karoon and Alice.<br><br>'They've grown this much?'<br><br>The two Transcendents had reached such a high level that it was hard to recall their previous appearance. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say they had caught up to him, excluding his Soul Sword.<br><br>'Impressive.'<br><br>He was amazed and curious about what kind of training they had undergone to achieve growth not inferior to his own. No, more than that, he was moved by the efforts of the two.<br><br>"You've worked hard" <br><br>Instead of a welcoming greeting, Raon acknowledged Karoon and Alice’s efforts.<br><br>"Ahem!"<br><br>Karoon cleared his throat, his face reddening as if he understood the meaning of Raon's words.<br><br>"As expected, you understand."<br><br>Alice hugged him tightly, saying she knew he would.<br><br>"You've changed a lot too. How did you grow so fast!"<br><br>As she laughed, saying his growth was even more surprising, the main door of the Head of House's training ground opened, and Glenn entered with the Heavenly Blade Division.<br><br>"We greet the Head of House!"<br><br>"We greet the Head of House!"<br><br>At Karoon's greeting, all the executives and martial forces in the training ground knelt and bowed their heads. Glenn walked to the center of the training ground with steps flowing with spirit and climbed onto the platform. His enormous and intimidating martial will caused cold sweat to run down the spines of the swordsmen.<br><br>"Everyone may rise."<br><br>At Glenn's low voice, the swordsmen raised their trembling knees.<br><br>"You've all worked hard during the two months of intensive training."<br><br>Glenn nodded as he looked over the swordsmen standing in the training ground one by one.<br><br>"Some of you may be wondering why we conducted intensive training for two months when it usually lasts one month or not at all."<br><br>He lowered his red gaze to look at Raon.<br><br>"The Light Wind Palace Master will explain the reason instead."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Raon nodded and climbed onto the platform. He calmly accepted the gazes of the swordsmen focused solely on him and parted his lips.<br><br>"You all know that our Light Wind Palace beheaded the 9th Apostle and stopped the White Blood Religion. However, there were a few more circumstances after that."<br><br>He explained everything that had happened to all the Zieghart swordsmen. Having already told Sylvia and Edgar in the annex earlier, the words flowed smoothly without hesitation.<br><br>"Y-you found the White Blood Religion's headquarters? Underwater?"<br><br>Alice's eyes widened as if she couldn't have imagined it.<br><br>"A war with the White Blood Religion..."<br><br>Karoon clenched his fist as if pleased to have an opportunity to unleash his grown power.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Denier remained silent, only looking at him and Glenn with calm eyes.<br><br>"An all-out war with the White Blood Religion?"<br><br>"Now I understand why we trained for two months..."<br><br>"Indeed. This makes that time meaningful."<br><br>"Strangely, I feel confident."<br><br>The swordsmen raised their fighting spirit, emitting powerful martial will, seemingly confident due to the intensive training they had undergone for two months.<br><br>"So when does this war start!" <br><br>Balder stepped forward in front of the platform, stomping the ground so hard it shook, as if excited about the war with the White Blood Religion.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Raon raised his finger towards the sky, looking not just at Balder but at the Zieghart swordsmen behind him.<br><br>"Now."<br><br>He pointed at the blue dimension appearing above his head and growled fiercely.<br><br>"The war has already begun."</p>
