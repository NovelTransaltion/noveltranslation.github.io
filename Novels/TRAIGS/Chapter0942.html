        <p>“Hmm...”<br><br>Raon turned his gaze to Karoon standing beside him.<br><br>“It would be best if the Master of Light Wind Palace did it. He's the only one who can explain this war from start to finish.”<br><br>Karoon crossed his arms and stepped back, as if refusing to step forward himself.<br><br>Since it was a public occasion, he seemed to be referring to him as the Master of Light Wind Palace out of respect. He was indeed a man of principle.<br><br>“That's right. Our Lord was at the center of every plan.”<br><br>Burren nodded emphatically, agreeing with Karoon.<br><br>“Not just the plans. He participated in every battle. Inside the dimension, the Black Tower climb, and the blood-soaked fight with the Black Tower Lord afterward.”<br><br>Martha raised her clenched fist, urging him to recount those exploits.<br><br>“Today, anything goes for the handsom Raon.”<br><br>Runaan gave a thumbs-up, declaring that since he was handsome, he could do anything. She seemed to think being good-looking was a universal pass these days.<br><br>“Hmm.”<br><br>Raon moistened his dry lips and stepped forward.<br><br>“Raon!”<br><br>“Our son!”<br><br>“Young Master!”<br><br>Sylvia, Edgar, Sia, and the maids waved their arms so vigorously their arms must have ached. They didn't know the details, but they seemed to know he had beheaded the Black Tower Lord.<br><br>“Well done! Raon!”<br><br>“Nephew! I believed in you!”<br><br>Aris and Balder, standing opposite Sylvia, beamed and clapped.<br><br>“......”<br><br>Denier was smiling beside them too. What could one say? His smile was bright, yet it felt different in tone from the others.<br><br>-What are you doing! Snap out of it and finish this quickly!<br><br>Wrath slammed his shoulder, urging a quick explanation.<br><br>-This king is hungry! I want to eat that home-cooked meal you bragged about to Gluttony!<br><br>Wrath clamped onto his own cheek, insisting they wrap things up and head back.<br><br>“Then I'll start from the beginning. We arrived at Montiro...”<br><br>Raon stepped forward, still clutched by Wrath. Under the gaze of everyone in the training ground, he recounted what had happened so far.<br><br>“...Thanks to Lord Chamber using her final move, the Black Tower Lord's guard slipped, and we were able to cut his throat.”<br><br>Since only a handful had ever seen the Demon Lords, he revealed only that they had killed the Black Tower Lord before stepping back.<br><br>“So it's true... you really did cut the Black Tower Lord's throat...”<br><br>Balder slammed his hand down, denting the railing.<br><br>“That's my nephew for you! Everyone look! That's my nephew!”<br><br>He bellowed so loudly it felt like everyone's eardrums would burst.<br><br>“Will you shut up?”<br><br>Aris covered her ears and smacked the back of Balder's head with her palm.<br><br>“I'm the only one who can call Raon my nephew!”<br><br>She gritted her teeth, vowing to kill him if he uttered the word ‘nephew’ again from that filthy mouth.<br><br>“Th-then what should I call him…?”<br><br>“Call him Master of Light Wind Palace!”<br><br>Aris raised her chin, telling him to figure it out himself.<br><br>“Master of Light Wind Palace ! I believed in you!”<br><br>Balder obeyed Aris's command without question, addressing Raon as Master of Light Wind Palace. His pride seemed to have completely vanished.<br><br>“You fought another grueling battle, didn't you….”<br><br>Sylvia's eyes reddened as if she had read the harrowing situation within Raon's brief explanation.<br><br>“Thank you, Karoon-nim....”<br><br>Edgar bowed his head to Karoon, seemingly recognizing how crucial his help had been in this war.<br><br>“That's my brother for you! Well done!”<br><br>Sia waved at Raon, shouting “Brother!” as if mimicking Balder. With so many people cheering his brother's name, she simply seemed pleased.<br><br>“Ahem!”<br><br>Glenn cleared his throat and stood up just as the audience's admiration and cheers for Raon began to turn into conversation.<br><br>“This war was the only path to shatter the balance of the Five Kings and Five Demons.”<br><br>He nodded heavily at Raon and Karoon.<br><br>“The Black Tower Lord put up fierce resistance, even creating a gate to the Demon Realm, but the Master of Light Wind Palace pursued relentlessly and severed his neck. Had the Great Mage of Balkar been defeated, we would have had to flee and hide in the shadows instead.”<br><br>Glenn looked at Raon with warm eyes.<br><br>“This war will be remembered in history, and at its center, the name Raon Zieghart will be etched.”<br><br>He nodded, acknowledging it was inevitable, whether he wanted it or not.<br><br>“It's not just the Master of Light Wind Palace. The Master of True Martial Palace, and everyone who participated in this war, have achieved feats that will be remembered for ten thousand years. You all worked hard, and I thank you.”<br><br>Glen thanked them and drew the Heavenly Tremor. Holding it upside down, he performed the Zieghart Sword Salute.<br><br>“L-Lord!”<br><br>“No! It was only my duty!”<br><br>The swordsmen hurriedly bowed their heads in response to Glen's salute. They seemed utterly unprepared for the Lord himself to express gratitude.<br><br>“Therefore, I grant every knight who participated in this war the right to choose one treasure from the gold chest and one treasure from Zieghart's treasury. And...”<br><br>Glen raised a finger, pointing at Raon and Karoon.<br><br>“Master of Light Wind Palace and The Master of True Martial Palace, who endured a harder war than anyone else, are permitted to take five treasures from the treasury.”<br><br>As if his decision was already made, he lowered his hand the moment he finished speaking.<br><br>“Wooooo!”<br><br>“Huh! They're actually sending them directly from Zigheart's treasury?”<br><br>“Elixirs, weapons, martial arts manuals, artifacts. There's nothing in that treasury they can't get!”<br><br>“What's the surprise? If they brought down the Black Tower, that's the least they deserve.”<br><br>“I actually think it's too little. The lords could easily receive ten times that amount.”<br><br>The audience nodded in agreement, deeming the reward fitting for the achievement.<br><br>“Then, dismissed. You've all worked hard.”<br><br>Glenn seemed to have gathered everyone solely for this purpose; the moment the reward discussion ended, he stepped down from the podium.<br><br>He gave Raon a nod of approval before leaving the training grounds.<br><br>‘I really have no idea what you’re thinking…’<br><br>Raon chuckled softly, turning away, only to catch Denier’s gaze fixed on him.<br><br>“……”<br><br>Denier clapped along with the others, his lips stretched into a long, drawn-out smile as if he’d achieved some goal.<br><br>Yet his eyes held not the joy of victory, but an emotionless, hollow emptiness.<br><br>‘Denier Zieghart.’<br><br>Raon tore his gaze away from him and bit his lip thinly.<br><br>‘What on earth are you thinking?’<br><br>***<br><br>“Haah...”<br><br>Lecros gazed up at the white ceiling, letting out a sigh so heavy it felt like the ground might collapse beneath him.<br><br>“This is utterly pathetic.”<br><br>Raon and Chamber had brought down the Black Tower, yet he couldn't even handle a single Derus, needing Glen's help.<br><br>He was too ashamed and embarrassed to lift his face.<br><br>“I suppose I should send Zieghart a gift.”<br><br>Raon had beheaded the Black Tower's master, and Glen had saved his life. Zieghart was practically the main protagonist of this war.<br><br>Since he hadn't been of any help, he felt he should at least send Zieghart a precious gift.<br><br>Damn it! If only I'd managed to dodge that first sword...<br><br>Lecros gritted his teeth, recalling his battle with Derus.<br><br>CRACK!<br><br>The ward door burst open, and Chamber, wearing a witch's hat, entered.<br><br>“Well, well! The little brat who got beaten up guarding the house is right here. Looking good, huh?”<br><br>Chamber peered at Lecros lying on the bed and stuck out her tongue playfully.<br><br>“You said not to treat you like a kid just because you got the nickname ‘Silent Sword Sovereign,’ but you're lying here after getting stabbed by Derus?”<br><br>She burst into a hearty laugh, clearly not here to comfort him but to tease him.<br><br>“You're, you're so damn strong!”<br><br>Lecros raised his head slightly and shook his fist.<br><br>“You're completely different from when I last saw you! I thought you were fighting Lord Glen!”<br><br>He snarled, insisting he wasn't weak. It was so unlike the figure he'd shown as the Silent Sword Sovereign and King of Owen.<br><br>“It's been a while since we saw little Lecros. Cute, huh?”<br><br>Chamber tapped Lecros's head, who was gritting his teeth in frustration.<br><br>“Tell this big sister everything.”<br><br>She nodded, promising to listen to it all.<br><br>“Ah, big sister is a bit much. There's an age difference...”<br><br>Lecros snapped back to reality at the word “sister” and waved his hands dismissively.<br><br>“You brat! Look at this firm skin!”<br><br>Chamber smacked Lecros' forehead, telling him not to bring up age.<br><br>“Hmm...”<br><br>Lecros touched his forehead where Chamber had hit him, narrowing his eyes.<br><br>“But who is that child you brought?”<br><br>He tilted his head, looking at Lencia hiding behind Chamber.<br><br>“My apprentice.”<br><br>Chamber pushed Lencia forward and grinned.<br><br>“Your... apprentice?”<br><br>“Yes. I found a raw gem with talent surpassing mine in Montiro. Expect great things—she's the next Archmage.”<br><br>She lifted her chin, seeming utterly confident in Rencia's future.<br><br>“H-Hello. I'm Rencia.”<br><br>The girl who introduced herself as Rencia bowed her head cautiously. She looked cute now, but she seemed destined to become a great beauty in the future.<br><br>“Hmm...”<br><br>Lecros looked into Rencia's green eyes and let out a short sigh.<br><br>'The Archmage's disciple.'<br><br>Chamber had taught many before, but declaring someone her disciple was exceedingly rare.<br><br>Yet, to go beyond simply taking on a disciple and assert her as the next Archmage? It felt like something in her nature had shifted.<br><br>“I heard you were badly injured. Did something change your perspective?”<br><br>Lecros lowered his hand as he looked at Chamber.<br><br>“It had to happen. I nearly died myself.”<br><br>Chamber smiled faintly and nodded.<br><br>“You look fine on the outside, but your upper dantian is severely torn. You'll need to rest and recuperate for quite some time.”<br><br>She let out a hollow laugh, saying she truly would have died if Saint Olga hadn't been there.<br><br>“Like Derus, the Black Tower Lord was also incredibly strong. Breaking free from the constraints of being human to cultivate power... it's only natural, I suppose.”<br><br>Chamber bit her red lips thinly.<br><br>“That's why I'm training a successor now, so I won't have to look back.”<br><br>She clenched her fist, saying she had no choice but to prepare for death in the coming war.<br><br>“Hmm...”<br><br>Lecros let out a low groan and looked at Lencia.<br><br>“Is it really appropriate to tell a young disciple to prepare for death?”<br><br>“Don't worry. This one might have stronger mental fortitude than you.”<br><br>Chamber waved her hand dismissively, saying she was a child who had weathered every storm and even tasted death.<br><br>“Her gaze is certainly different.”<br><br>Lecros nodded, then extended his hand to Lencia.<br><br>“I am Lecros. It seems we shall have much to do together.”<br><br>He added a polite request for her cooperation, showing courtesy even to the young Lencia.<br><br>“I-I'll do my best too! Your Majesty!”<br><br>Lencia raised her trembling arm and grasped Lecros's hand.<br><br>“I've learned a lot through this incident as well.”<br><br>Lecros ruffled Lencia's hair and narrowed his eyes.<br><br>“I've spent too much time as a king, setting aside my life as a warrior. It seems the time has come to become obsessed with swordsmanship again.”<br><br>He gritted his teeth, saying he wanted revenge on Derus.<br><br>“Revenge. That's good. But we might not get the chance to step in.”<br><br>Chamber smiled and raised a single finger.<br><br>“The backwave is coming higher and faster than we thought.”<br><br>“Are you referring to the Sword Emperor?”<br><br>Lecros realized Chamber meant Raon by the “backwave” and nodded.<br><br>“Yes. Unlike you, the Sword Emperor with nothing attached to his title! If you're the Sword Sovereign, then he's the Sword Emperor—what's this ‘Silent Sword Sovereign’ nonsense? It sounds weak!”<br><br>Chamber shook her head in disdain.<br><br>“Keeeenng...”<br><br>Lecros shrugged his shoulders, seemingly angry that his title had been insulted.<br><br>“But, but... Silent Sword Lord is the title I gained right after becoming a Transcendent! If its decided now, it'll be a different title!”<br><br>His face flushed red like a child's as he argued with Chamber.<br><br>“Just as I thought, your face turns red when you get excited.”<br><br>Chamber chuckled softly and tapped Lecros lightly on the forehead.<br><br>“Hmm...”<br><br>King Lecros bowed his head deeply, seemingly realizing he'd been teased by Chamber.<br><br>“Jokes aside, Raon is the real deal.”<br><br>“I'm well aware of that child's exceptional talent.”<br><br>“That's not what I mean.”<br><br>Chamber chuckled and shook her head.<br><br>“Want to hear something funny? Raon was meditating during the victory celebration for the war. Reflecting on what we lacked in battle, no less.”<br><br>She gazed out the window facing north and licked her lips.<br><br>“That kid won't stop at just Sword Emperor. Definitely.”<br><br>***<br><br>" Everyone's here."<br><br>Glenn nodded, surveying the Light Wind Palace and True Martial Palace knights gathered in the audience chamber.<br><br>“Then let's get straight to it without further ado.”<br><br>Glenn flicked his fingers, his arm draped over the throne.<br><br>Ta-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a<br><br>“Follow me.”<br><br>Glenn gestured to the knights as he stepped into the shimmering golden dimension.<br><br>“Th-this is Zieghart's treasury...”<br><br>“I've seen it with my own eyes, but never imagined I'd actually enter it.”<br><br>“Huh, my trembling won't stop.”<br><br>The Light Wind Palace and True Martial Palace Knights trembled with emotion, seemingly moved just by the chance to enter Zieghart's treasury.<br><br>“Enter.”<br><br>Karoon nodded calmly, as if he'd been inside the treasury before, and stepped into the golden dimension.<br><br>-What the hell are you doing!<br><br>Wrath grabbed his shoulder and shook him.<br><br>-Just pick something and let's go eat already!<br><br>The guy was clenching his teeth, saying he was starving to death.<br><br>‘I'll let you eat until you are full. So just wait for a moment.’<br><br>It was just as Raon pushed Wrath aside and was about to enter Zieghart's treasury.<br><br>Woooooom!<br><br>A message tinged with blue light appeared before the golden dimension.<br><br>[The trait Greed is unlocked.]</p>
