        <p>"Alright. Let's adjourn then."<br><br>Glenn waved his hand, his complexion smooth and radiant as if he had grown 30 years younger.<br><br>"I wondered why you suddenly called us, but it seems there was a good reason."<br><br>"Indeed! I never imagined we'd form an alliance with the Five Divine Orders in just one day."<br><br>"On top of that, you even awakened the Thespian Emperor and the Queen of Swords. What kind of ability is this?"<br><br>"There's a reason he's the youngest Palace Master in history. It might be too late to start lining up now."<br><br>The executives glanced at Raon repeatedly before leaving the audience chamber.<br><br>"Our nephew never fails to amaze me every time I see him!"<br><br>Balder patted his own shoulder, praising Raon's excellence.<br><br>"You've accomplished something truly remarkable. Well done, and thank you."<br><br>Denier also smiled and gave a slightly delayed applause.<br><br>"Let's have a meal together later!"<br><br>Balder said he would host a banquet and asked Raon to come to the True Martial Palace before leaving the Lord's Manor with Denier.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he recalled Denier's gentle smile.<br><br>'It's like he's become a different person.'<br><br>Before, Denier had exuded an inexplicable gloominess and coldness, but now he radiated warmth like Balder. Raon couldn't figure out what kind of person he really was.<br><br>"Ah! Him. No, I mean, we should have definitely brought the Light Wind Palace Master during the selection ceremony..."<br><br>Serena, the Void Sword Division Leader, clicked her tongue in lingering regret.<br><br>"As if that would have been possible. That damn gambler would have done anything to keep Raon by his side."<br><br>Sheryl waved her hand, saying that because of Rimmer, Raon's affiliation would never have changed.<br><br>"That's right. He had his eye on Raon for a long time."<br><br>Roenn chuckled, seemingly thinking of Rimmer, as he saw off Serena and the remaining executives.<br><br>"Phew..."<br><br>Raon looked around the audience chamber, now empty except for Glenn and himself, and let out a heavy sigh.<br><br>'I'm exhausted.'<br><br>Repeating the same story, and then having to do it again under the scrutiny of the family executives, had left him mentally drained.<br><br>'At least it's fortunate that Karoon and Alice weren't here.'<br><br>The two were training together and couldn't attend, but if they had been here, their intense gazes would have made him even more exhausted.<br><br>"Good job."<br><br>Glenn nodded with a satisfied smile. Judging by his radiant expression, he seemed genuinely pleased.<br><br>"You must be tired, so you should head back..."<br><br>"There's something I'd like to ask."<br><br>Raon stepped forward, saying he had a question before leaving.<br><br>"Not just one, you can ask ten if you'd like."<br><br>Glenn spoke kindly, as if he would answer any question.<br><br>-What, has he become a different person?<br><br>Wrath snorted in disbelief.<br><br>-He wasn't originally like this, was he?<br><br>He frowned, wondering where Glenn's usual gruff manner of speaking had gone.<br><br>'I'm not sure either...'<br><br>Raon let out a short sigh.<br><br>'I think he's changed like this since we rescued my sister...'<br><br>Raon wasn't sure if Glenn had always been like this and was just holding back, or if meeting Sia and Edgar had triggered an emotional awakening.<br><br>"The Thespian Emperor and the Queen of Swords awakened while sparring with me. I believe it wasn't a coincidence, but rather because I've reached the realm of Soul Sword."<br><br>Raon clasped his hands in front of him as he looked at Glenn, who had leaned away from the throne.<br><br>"Grandfather, have you ever felt any physical or mental changes after reaching the realm of Soul Sword?"<br><br>Although he had acquired the Spirit Transformation trait, Raon hadn't yet figured out how to use it properly, so he wanted to ask Glenn about it.<br><br>"As you say, it's certain that your soul had a significant impact on the minds of the Thespian Emperor and the Queen of Swords, who were experiencing soul demons."<br><br>Glenn smiled, agreeing with Raon's thoughts.<br><br>"Soul Sword is the ultimate martial art that sharpens one's soul to cut the enemy's soul. However, since it requires using all of one's soul to forge the sword of the mind, it's not easy to influence others."<br><br>He shook his head, saying he had never experienced anything like what Raon described.<br><br>"Then why did I..."<br><br>"As I've said before, you possess a soul far greater than your current martial prowess. It seems that even after creating a Soul Sword suitable for your level, the excess realm of your soul had a positive influence on the Thespian Emperor and the Queen of Swords."<br><br>Glenn lowered his hand, saying that was likely the only reason.<br><br>"It's remarkable. Usually, at a young age, one's realm of the soul should be small even when reaching high levels, but yours is overwhelmingly large even compared to mine at that time."<br><br>He tilted his head, saying it was difficult to understand by his common sense.<br><br>"Perhaps it's because you've been through battles and experiences that few others could endure. In any case, it's a good thing."<br><br>Glenn leaned back on the throne, offering his congratulations.<br><br>"However, while it's good to help develop others' martial arts..."<br><br>He tapped the damaged armrest of the throne with his finger.<br><br>"Don't neglect honing your own sword. Unlike mine, your Soul Sword has the potential for infinite growth."<br><br>Glenn smiled warmly, expressing his anticipation to see Raon's unique Soul Sword.<br><br>"I'll keep that in mind."<br><br>Raon bowed respectfully to Glenn.<br><br>"You must be tired, so go and rest."<br><br>"Yes, then I'll take my leave."<br><br>Raon backed out of the audience chamber without turning his back on Glenn, who was chuckling contentedly.<br><br>-Let's hurry back!<br><br>Wrath tugged at his sleeve even before they left the Lord's Manor.<br><br>-I'm hungry, let's go home and eat first!<br><br>He shook his head, asking Raon to take care of his missed meals since he hadn't eaten properly while in Barene.<br><br>"Let's take care of something first."<br><br>Instead of returning directly to the annex building, Raon whistled in front of the Lord's Manor. Shortly after, a young swallow descended from the sky with a soft cry, landing on his palm.<br><br>"Have you been well?"<br><br>Raon smiled as he stroked the young swallow's head. The bird chirped, lifting its leg as if to say it had been playing well.<br><br>"I thought you were a bit injured, but I'm glad you've healed."<br><br>After placing the swallow on his shoulder, Raon took out a white paper from his pocket and began writing a letter.<br><br>"I'm counting on you."<br><br>After tying the completed letter to the swallow's leg, he sent it flying into the sky. The young swallow circled once above Raon's head as if to say not to worry, then quickly flew south.<br><br>-Did you send it to that old geezer?<br><br>Wrath jerked his chin, as if asking if the letter was sent to Rector.<br><br>'Judging from his replies, it seems he likes my letters.'<br><br>Raon smiled, saying he'd probably need to keep sending letters in the future.<br><br>-You must find it troublesome too.<br><br>Wrath clicked his tongue briefly.<br><br>-Having to take care of two clingy old men.<br><br>'No, I actually like it.'<br><br>Raon shook his head firmly.<br><br>'It's much better to have even one person than to have no one at all.'<br><br>Unlike his past life where he had no family or acquaintances, now he had many people to care for, and it made his heart warm and happy beyond measure.<br><br>'Let's go back to the annex building.'<br><br>Smiling, he placed his hand on Wrath's head.<br><br>'I'll take care of you too.'<br><br>-Oh! Then bring me grilled and fried beef, pork, lamb, chicken, along with pineapple pizza, shrimp pasta, and tuna...<br><br>'Suddenly, it's becoming a hassle.'<br><br>Raon shook his head as he watched Wrath endlessly listing menu items.<br><br>'I think I'll have to remove you from the list of people to take care of.'<br><br>-Why!<br><br>***<br><br>"If you're done talking, I'm leaving."<br><br>As soon as the meeting ended, the Leader of the White Blood Religion snorted and disappeared through the door.<br><br>"I'll be going too."<br><br>Rector briefly smacked his lips and stood up.<br><br>"Thank you for coming all this way, Leader of the Holy Sword Alliance."<br><br>Derus bowed respectfully to Rector.<br><br>"As I mentioned, I hope you'll absorb the surrounding forces one by one while keeping a low profile. That position should keep you hidden from everyone."<br><br>He smiled gently, asking Rector to pay attention to what was discussed in the meeting.<br><br>"Don't worry."<br><br>Rector nodded as he walked towards the door.<br><br>'This guy gives me the creeps.'<br><br>Rector felt his blood boil seeing Derus talk like that after blatantly visiting the Holy Sword Alliance's holy ground, which no one else knew about, as if it were a tourist attraction. That guy was a monster, both in terms of martial prowess and mental capacity.<br><br>"I understand."<br><br>"Ah, one more thing."<br><br>As Rector was about to open the door handle and leave, Derus raised his hand.<br><br>"Even if you have close acquaintances in the Five Divine Orders, please don't make any alliance proposals. Those two have already sided with the Five Kings."<br><br>Derus shook his head as if to say it was too late to act.<br><br>"The Five Divine Orders?"<br><br>Rector swallowed dryly as he turned to look at Derus.<br><br>"Yes. It's a done deal, so don't worry about that side."<br><br>Derus showed no anger or confusion despite knowing that the Five Divine Orders, directly under the Five Demons, had sided with the Five Kings. Rector couldn't tell if this information was true or if Derus was testing him, but just looking into the man's calm eyes sent chills down his spine.<br><br>"...I see."<br><br>Rector forcibly hid his tension as he left the conference room. As he exited the path flickering with white light, he saw the mountain leading to the Holy Sword Alliance.<br><br>'Now he's openly showing that he knows the location of the Holy Sword Alliance.'<br><br>When they had entered, the door had been opened far from this place, but now he was returned right in front of the mountain. It seemed as if Derus was demonstrating that he knew everything about the Holy Sword Alliance.<br><br>'What an unpleasant bastard.'<br><br>Rector let out a heavy sigh as he passed through the cave and entered the Holy Sword Alliance's holy ground.<br><br>"Master!"<br><br>Mustan, who had been sweeping the yard, put down his broom and approached him.<br><br>"A letter has arrived from him!"<br><br>He handed Rector a white paper, saying that Raon had sent another letter.<br><br>"Is that so?"<br><br>Rector felt the oppressive aura of Derus lift from his shoulders as he took the letter from Raon.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>However, his expression darkened as he read the letter.<br><br>"M-Master? Is there a problem?"<br><br>Mustan swallowed hard as he observed Rector's tense face.<br><br>"Raon says he's formed an alliance with the Five Divine Orders."<br><br>Rector gritted his teeth as he slightly crumpled the letter.<br><br>"What? That's a good thing, why would you make such a face...."<br><br>Mustan blinked, seemingly unable to understand.<br><br>"Yes. As you say, it is good news. However..."<br><br>Rector bit his lip hard with his white teeth.<br><br>"Derus already knew about this."<br><br>Recalling what Derus had said before returning to the Holy Sword Alliance, a chill ran down his spine.<br><br>'Just how much does that monster know?'<br><br>The thought that he was becoming increasingly dangerous began to sink deeper into his mind like a thorn.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>Mustan also let out a sigh, seeming to understand the implications.<br><br>"T-Then, let's send a message to Lord Raon!"<br><br>He brought paper and a pen, suggesting they write a letter immediately.<br><br>"No, this is something we need to discuss in person. There are things I need to show him as well."<br><br>Rector shook his head, thinking of the Divine Shine he had stored in his Subspace Pouch.<br><br>"Y-Yes, you're right."<br><br>Mustan let out a low groan, seemingly remembering Derus's white hawk that had caught the swallow.<br><br>'Derus Robert...'<br><br>Rector clenched his fist as he recalled Derus's ever-composed face.<br><br>'Is he even human?'<br><br>His eloquence, mental capacity, and martial prowess were all on a different level from ordinary people. Especially those calm eyes that seemed to read one's soul, just looking at them was suffocating.<br><br>"Shall we prepare to depart for Zieghart right away?"<br><br>Mustan smacked his lips, suggesting they move immediately.<br><br>"No, there's something we need to do before we go."<br><br>Rector shook his head firmly. He exhaled deeply as he gazed at the distant mountains.<br><br>"We need to find someone who can stop Derus Robert."<br><br>***<br><br>Raon stood on the platform, looking at the Light Wind Palace Swordsmen lined up in the fifth training ground.<br><br>"What kind of training are we doing today that you called us to gather from dawn?"<br><br>Martha tapped her foot impatiently, as if urging to start quickly.<br><br>"Yaaawn..."<br><br>Runaan had managed not to be late, but she rubbed her eyes and yawned, seemingly lacking sleep.<br><br>"Don't rush. He'll do it in his own time."<br><br>Burren crossed his arms, telling them to wait for the Palace Master's intentions.<br><br>"You all saw how the Thespian Emperor and the Queen of Swords awakened while sparring with me, right?"<br><br>Raon stood at the edge of the platform and tilted his chin.<br><br>"We saw it! I never thought even such Transcendents could suddenly enter a state of enlightenment!"<br><br>Krein nodded vigorously, expressing his amazement.<br><br>"It was incredible..."<br><br>Runaan blinked, saying it was something she had never seen before.<br><br>"Why don't I have such luck!"<br><br>Martha bit her lip deeply, seemingly envious of the Thespian Emperor and the Queen of Swords.<br><br>"Actually, it wasn't a coincidence."<br><br>Raon shook his head at the Light Wind Palace Swordsmen who were discussing the incident.<br><br>"Not a coincidence?"<br><br>"What do you mean?"<br><br>Trevin and Martha raised their heads simultaneously.<br><br>"The Head of House said that my soul, which has entered the realm of Soul Sword, has started to have a positive influence on others."<br><br>Raon explained the content of the Spirit Transformation trait to the Light Wind Palace Swordsmen, quoting Glenn's words.<br><br>"In other words, not just the Thespian Emperor and the Queen of Swords, but you all can awaken too."<br><br>He nodded, saying that they could also enter a state of enlightenment and quickly raise their level of martial arts like those two.<br><br>"Is... is that true?"<br><br>"How do we do it?"<br><br>"I'll do it no matter what!"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace Swordsmen raised their hands roughly and raised their voices, seemingly shocked at the possibility of entering a state of enlightenment.<br><br>"I'll do it unconditionally. Whatever it takes!"<br><br>Martha clenched her fist, saying she would participate in anything.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Runaan nodded slightly as she watched Martha.<br><br>"To be honest, I'm not sure how to do it either. However..."<br><br>Raon grinned as he rotated his wrist.<br><br>"Hmmm..."<br><br>Dorian's eyes trembled fearfully, his mouth shut as if he sensed something.<br><br>"If we keep at it like the Thespian Emperor and the Queen of Swords, won't it work out somehow?"<br><br>Raon descended from the platform with a cool smile.<br><br>"Huh...?"<br><br>"No way, you've mastered Soul Sword, and you're going to do it so crudely?"<br><br>"It's not even sparring, what do you mean by getting hit...?"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace Swordsmen trembled, their jaws quivering as if they hadn't even considered this possibility.<br><br>"Let's start and see. We have plenty of time. First..."<br><br>Raon pointed at Krein, who was floundering like a freshly caught fish.<br><br>"Krein, you're up first..."<br><br>"I'll go first. Please."<br><br>Martha stepped forward in front of the pale-faced Krein, drawing her sword.<br><br>"...Alright."<br><br>Raon twisted his lips into a smile as he looked at Martha with her serious expression.<br><br>"It won't take long anyway."<br><br>***<br><br>The sun that had risen to the center of the sky now sank, and a crimson twilight emerged. The swordsmen who had been standing in the training ground were now collapsed on the floor, dry heaving like the faded sunlight.<br><br>"Urghhhh..."<br><br>"Th-this is worse than usual!"<br><br>"It really wasn't sparring, but just getting beaten..."<br><br>"Th-this is one-sided violence!"<br><br>"And no one even awakened..."<br><br>The Light Wind Palace Swordsmen crawled on the floor, crying out that it was too much.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Raon lowered the Heavenly Drive in his hand and briefly smacked his lips.<br><br>'I don't know how to use Spirit Transformation.'<br><br>From morning till evening, he had tried to awaken their potential through sparring with the Light Wind Palace Swordsmen, from Martha to Dorian. But not a single one of them had entered a state of enlightenment.<br><br>-What kind of sparring was that!<br><br>Wrath frowned in disbelief.<br><br>-Didn't you just beat them one-sidedly! It's just stress relief!<br><br>He shook his head, telling Raon to call it what it really was.<br><br>'At least I tried.'<br><br>Raon chuckled as he sheathed the Heavenly Drive at his waist.<br><br>'I guess we'll stop here for today.'<br><br>He had beaten the swordsmen to the point where they could barely move, so it seemed pointless to continue.<br><br>"Tomorrow again..."<br><br>Just as Raon was about to wave his hand and tell them to rest...<br><br>"Continue..."<br><br>Martha used her sword as a cane to lift herself up.<br><br>"Please continue."<br><br>She raised her sword, indicating it wasn't over yet.<br><br>"Me too..."<br><br>Runaan looked at Martha and then stood up.<br><br>"We're not done yet."<br><br>She too raised her sword, suggesting they continue sparring. Rather than feeling rivalry towards Martha, she seemed to want to join her as a friend.<br><br>"Alright."<br><br>Just as Raon was about to draw his sword again with a smirk...<br><br>'Huh...?'<br><br>A very faint light began to bloom near Martha and Runaan's hearts.</p>
