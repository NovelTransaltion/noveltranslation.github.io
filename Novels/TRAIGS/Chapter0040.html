        <h1 class="text-center">The Reincarnated Assassin is a Genius Swordsman</h1>
        <h3 class="my-5">Chapter 40</h3>
        <p>A silver line was flowing through the white snow, falling down like a torrent. It was the march of armored knights.<br><br>“Are you okay, my lord prince?”<br><br>A middle-aged man with a huge, bear-like build looked at the boy walking right next to him.<br><br>“I’m still fine. But the knight trainees seem to be struggling because it’s snowing more heavily than expected.”<br><br>The prince turned around. Unlike the composed prince, the knight trainees clearly looked tired.<br><br>“Is Zieghart still far away?”<br><br>“It looks like we are almost there, since this heavy snow is getting worse.”<br><br>“Almost there? Then do Zieghart’s swordsmen endure this snow every day?”<br><br>“That’s not the case.”<br><br>The middle-aged knight shook his head while smiling lightly.<br><br>“The weather becomes worse the closer we get to the Zieghart, but…”<br><br>As soon as he said that, the violent snow suddenly stopped, and the sun hiding behind the gray cloud finally appeared.<br><br>“The weather inside Zieghart is perfectly clear. The temperature is lower, though.”<br><br>“Huh…”<br><br>The prince looked up at the sky in surprise. It was so clear that he felt like the endless snowstorm was just a dream.<br><br>“Wow!”<br><br>“Th-the snow stopped immediately.”<br><br>The others’ jaws also dropped.<br><br>“Duke Tartan, what is this weather…?”<br><br>“It looks like magic, but it isn’t. This strange natural environment is the reason that Zieghart is called a natural fortress.”<br><br>The middle-aged man named Duke Tartan smiled, pointing towards the huge rampart that could be seen further ahead.<br><br>“Although, they have been broken through before.”<br><br>“Hmm…”<br><br>Since the prince knew about that occasion, he nodded calmly.<br><br>“Since they are waiting for us, let’s enter first.”<br><br>Duke Tartan pointed towards the people waiting under Zieghart’s rampart.<br><br>In front of an enormous iron door, which was big enough to fit a giant, swordsmen wearing red coats were looking towards them with sharp gazes.<br><br>“Okay.”<br><br>The prince nodded shortly and headed towards the iron gate, where the Zieghart’s gatekeepers were standing.<br><br> <br><br>***<br><br> <br><br>Raon, who was about to return to the training ground after lunch, stopped.<br><br>‘What is that?’<br><br>From the direction of the front gate, he could feel the presence of many people. The sound of armor bumping into each other was a metallic sound that couldn’t usually be heard in Zieghart.<br><br>Soon enough, the foreign minister Illiune appeared, and the knights clad in silver armor followed him.<br><br>‘The Owen kingdom…’<br><br>There was a lion’s head drawn on the left side of their silver armor. It was the Owen Kingdom’s emblem.<br><br>The other trainees and swordsmen also stopped walking, watching the Owen Kingdom’s knights passing by.<br><br>“They are the envoys of the Owen Kingdom.”<br><br>Dorian stood next to him and gently whistled.<br><br>“Envoys?”<br><br>“They’ve been cleaning everywhere in the household because of the Owen Kingdom’s envoys. Did you not know?”<br><br>“I didn’t. But their numbers are pretty small for an envoy.”<br><br>Raon furrowed his brows, looking at the small children walking behind the knights.<br><br>“Ah, they are the knight trainees that came along with the third prince of the Owen Kingdom. They must be here to get some experience.”<br><br>“You are knowledgeable.”<br><br>“Because there were rumors about it. Look, everyone looks like they knew about it already.”<br><br>“That’s true.”<br><br>It looked like he was the only one who didn’t know about it, and maybe Runaan, who was usually just blank.<br><br>Raon looked through the kingdom’s envoys.<br><br>‘They are pretty strong.’<br><br>The knight trainees were as strong as the trainees in the fifth training ground, as if they were proving they were from the Six Kings just like the Ziegharts.<br><br>‘Well, whether they are strong or not doesn’t really matter to me… huh?’<br><br>When he was turning around to head towards the training ground, he met the eyes of the knight trainee that was standing at the frontmost.<br><br>His sky like blue eyes contained an unshakable spirit.<br><br>‘He is pretty strong for his age.’<br><br>He understood it just by looking at him. That knight trainee was the strongest of them.<br><br>‘However.’<br><br>That assessment was considering his age, and he still had a long way to go to be considered good for Raon.<br><br>As expected, the blue-eyed child couldn’t read Raon’s strength, turning around after looking at him for a moment.<br><br>‘I have no time to pay attention to something like that.’<br><br>He was busy completing his footwork and swordsmanship. Since he wasn’t going to meet the kingdom’s envoys, watching them for a moment was plenty.<br><br>Raon walked towards the training ground, only thinking about the footwork’s flows.<br><br> <br><br>***<br><br> <br><br>‘What is this…?’<br><br>For the first time in his life, the third prince of the Owen Kingdom, Greer De Owen felt a chill go down his spine.<br><br>He slowly raised his head. The more his gaze raised, the more difficult it became for him to breathe.<br><br>Everything was because of the man who that sitting at the top.<br><br>The Destructive King of the North, Glenn Zieghart. The man called the strongest swordsman of the continent zapped all his strength from his limbs just from being seen.<br><br>“Thank you for your effort on your trip.”<br><br>“Thank you for your warm welcome.”<br><br>He barely managed to come to his senses thanks to Duke Tartan’s voice from next to him.<br><br>“He looks exactly like the previous king in his youth. I can understand why he cherishes you so much.”<br><br>Glenn Zieghart slowly nodded, watching his face.<br><br>“Th-thank you.”<br><br>He couldn’t talk properly because his mouth was completely dry. His presence was too overbearing, despite not using any pressure. It was a completely different experience from when he met the Kingdom’s best sword.<br><br>“I-I have a letter from his majesty the king.”<br><br>The third prince took out a golden envelope. He forced his trembling legs to stand up.<br><br>“Kuh…”<br><br>While shivering, he approached the platform and handed over the letter.<br><br>“Hmm.”<br><br>Upon seeing that, Glenn’s eyes shone for a second, but quickly disappeared.<br><br>“As you’ve requested, I’ve arranged things so that you can observe the trainees.”<br><br>Putting the letter aside, Glenn slowly spoke.<br><br>“I’ve prepared an evening banquet, so do rest for today and visit them tomorrow.”<br><br>“Thank you for your consideration.”<br><br>“Then see you again later.”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>The third prince took three steps backward and bowed, then stood up.<br><br>“And the duke…”<br><br>“I have something to tell the head of house about. Please go ahead and rest.”<br><br>Duke Tartan closed his eyes while smiling lightly.<br><br>“I see.”<br><br>The third prince nodded shortly, then left the audience chamber.<br><br>“He is a very talented child. He will rise to the throne of the sword, before the throne of the king.”<br><br>Glenn opened his mouth first, after a short silence.<br><br>“I knew you would realize it at a glance. The third prince is called the Kingdom’s best sword in waiting.”<br><br>“Certainly, it is a rare talent.”<br><br>“It’s not just about talent, he also has a strong willpower. He also visited the south to witness Robert’s swordsmanship.”<br><br>Duke Tartan smiled happily, looking at the door through which the third prince had left.<br><br>“Hmph.”<br><br>Glenn slightly lifted the corners of his mouth.<br><br>‘Talent, effort and willpower, huh…’<br><br>Just by looking at the third prince’s eyes, he could tell what kind of talent he had and what kind of efforts he’d been making.<br><br>He must have experienced various things and worked hard from a young age. However, Glenn knew somebody even better than him.<br><br>Raon Zieghart.<br><br>Since he knew about Raon’s effort and willpower, he wasn’t convinced with the third prince’s greatness.<br><br>“Since you didn’t come here to show off the prince, let’s get to the point.”<br><br>The letter in Glenn’s hand burned up.<br><br>“You burned it without even taking a look.”<br><br>Although the letter was burned up, Duke Tartan’s expression didn’t change.<br><br>“There’s no way he would’ve entrusted an important letter to a child.”<br><br>“I knew it.”<br><br>Duke Tartan knelt and respectfully lowered his head, unlike when he was boasting about the third prince.<br><br>“I will convey the words of the king of Owen Kingdom, Lacrosse Albert de Owen the second.”<br><br>When he raised his head, his eyes were completely serious.<br><br>“The five darknesses have started to move.”<br><br> <br><br>* * *<br><br> <br><br>Pow!<br><br> <br><br>Raon’s right hand advanced as smoothly as a salmon swimming upstream.<br><br>His left foot followed. His lower body moved as fluently as a deer running through the forest.<br><br>It wasn’t fast but smooth, not powerful but abrupt.<br><br>The twelve forms of the River Footwork that he was using looked as cheerful and free as a leaf riding the wind.<br><br> <br><br>Thud!<br><br> <br><br>With a step shaking the ground, he finished training the River Footwork.<br><br>“Huff…”<br><br>Exhaling an excited breath, he raised his head, straightening his back.<br><br>‘They are still watching.’<br><br>When he looked around, the trainees, who were watching him train, turned in surprise.<br><br>Ever since the first day they’d learned the River Footwork, they’d been training while watching him instead of the instructors.<br><br>Burren, Runaan, and Martha weren’t exceptions, either.<br><br>“Um!”<br><br>“Hmph.”<br><br>Burren and Martha snorted upon meeting his eyes and turned around.<br><br>“Mhm.”<br><br>Of course, Runaan didn’t avoid his gaze. Instead, she came closer to him and performed her footwork. That meant she wanted him to teach her.<br><br>“Oh, well.”<br><br>Raon shook his head and pointed out what Runaan was lacking in her footwork.<br><br>“Young master, can you teach me too?”<br><br>Dorian approached him while scratching his belly pocket, showing him his footwork.<br><br>“To begin with, your posture is too high. Get a bit lower…”<br><br>When he was pointing out his problems, the door to the training ground opened and Rimmer entered.<br><br>‘Why is he here?’<br><br>Raon frowned, watching Rimmer trotting in. It was the first time he came to visit during break time.<br><br>“Does everyone know about the Owen Kingdom’s envoy visiting us today?”<br><br>“Yes, we do.”<br><br>Burren stepped up and responded. His round eyes looked surprised that Rimmer was visiting during break time.<br><br>“They are going to hold a banquet for the envoys this evening. Since they have knight trainees, those of you who are the same age as them are also allowed to participate.”<br><br>“Oh!”<br><br>“Banquet?”<br><br>The trainees' expressions brightened at the thought of meeting the Owen Kingdom’s knights and becoming acquainted with the knight trainees.<br><br>“However!”<br><br>Rimmer shook his head.<br><br>“You haven’t even properly acquired the River Footwork yet. If it were me, I’d be too ashamed to participate, for sure!”<br><br>“Ugh!”<br><br>“Th-that is…”<br><br>The trainees bit their lips to the unexpected words.<br><br>“Ah? Were you planning to participate? But you still have lots of training left to do, right? You haven’t completed the swordsmanship nor the footwork, though?”<br><br>He sticked out his face and teased them as he looked through the trainees.<br><br>“Da-damn it!”<br><br>“Haa…”<br><br>The trainees lowered their heads, speechless.<br><br>“There’s only one person who is qualified to participate.”<br><br>Rimmer’s gaze was directed at Raon.<br><br>“What are you gonna do?”<br><br>“I’m not interested.”<br><br>Raon shook his head and picked up his training sword. His River Footwork was almost perfect, but he still had a long way to go until he could combine it with his swordsmanship.<br><br>It wasn’t time for him to make personal connections through a banquet. It was time to do his best in training.<br><br>“That’s a good attitude.”<br><br>Rimmer smiled. He had a satisfied expression, as if saying that he knew it.<br><br>“Well, if you really want to go, I’ll allow it. Does anyone want to?”<br><br>Putting his hand on Raon’s shoulder, he looked through the trainees.<br><br>He seemed to be asking whether they wanted to go when Raon, the strongest one among them, wanted to keep training.<br><br>“Hmph!”<br><br>“…Nope.”<br><br>Martha and Burren turned around and stepped away to train.<br><br>“……” <br><br>Runaan hadn’t been listening to Rimmer from the beginning and had been practicing footwork.<br><br>“Well, keep training then. There will be plenty of banquets to participate in once you get stronger! I’m gonna leave then.”<br><br>Rimmer shook his hand as if he were making fun of them and left the training ground.<br><br>“Hmm…”<br><br>Raon scratched his chin while watching him leave. Considering Rimmer’s personality, he would’ve allowed them to participate in a banquet. It was a bit strange that he had stopped them, instead.<br><br>‘What is he thinking about now?’<br><br> <br><br>***<br><br> <br><br>The splendid lights were shining upon the main building’s banquet hall, instead of the heavy snows.<br><br>The third prince of the Owen Kingdom, Greer De Owen, sat at his designated seat while licking his lips.<br><br>‘I’m tired.’<br><br>His head was spinning from greeting people from Zieghart for hours. He just wanted to practice his sword, since something like a banquet made him uncomfortable.<br><br>The king’s order wasn’t the only reason that he was participating in something he didn’t enjoy.<br><br>Zieghart’s sword.<br><br>And the swordsmen who practiced that sword. It was in order to observe them.<br><br>“Haa.”<br><br>The third prince gulped down the drink on the table and frowned.<br><br>‘They are certainly amazing warriors.’<br><br>The pressures of Zieghart’s warriors were proud and powerful. Their might didn’t lose to the Owen Kingdom’s knights, which filled him with excitement.<br><br>‘However.’<br><br>The might of Zieghart’s young swordsmen was completely disappointing.<br><br>If it was another house or kingdom, they would’ve been called extremely talented people, but they were a bit lacking to be called the Six King’s trainees.<br><br>‘They are even worse than Robert's.’<br><br>The head of the southern house Robert, which he’d visited before coming to Zieghart, seemed to have better young swordsmen than them.<br><br>“I don’t think I need to look around tomorrow.”<br><br>Glenn had allowed him to observe the training, but he didn’t have any reason to visit, considering their levels.<br><br>“You look disappointed.”<br><br>“Huff!”<br><br>He hurriedly turned around, hearing a light voice coming from behind.<br><br>“El-elf?”<br><br>A red-haired and dark green-eyed elf was smiling, his hands behind his back.<br><br>“Do you want to see the real deal?”</p>
