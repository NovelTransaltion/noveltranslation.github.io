        <p>"Hmm..."<br><br>Glenn lowered his trembling hand and looked at Raon again.<br><br>'I thought he wouldn't have changed much.'<br><br>But he's surpassed my expectations by far. The Room of Self has been a place where countless Swordsmen have entered since the beginning of Zieghart's history. However, not everyone who enters the Room of Self comes out significantly stronger.<br><br>As Karoon explained to the children, many Swordsmen who hadn't hit a wall for a long time entered the Room of Self and came out without any changes.<br><br>That's why a temporary regulation was made to allow only Grandmasters or those facing the wall of Transcendence to enter the Room of Self.<br><br>'Of course, that child was different.'<br><br>Even for Raon, it seemed nearly impossible to reach the wall beyond Transcendence, so I allowed him to enter the Room of Self according to his will, but I didn't expect this outcome.<br><br>'I can tell just by looking.'<br><br>Glenn let out a sigh as he sensed Raon's calm gaze and deeply settled aura.<br><br>'The quantity and density of his aura have increased dramatically, and the quality of his muscles has changed too. Moreover...'<br><br>It seems he's reached a new level in swordsmanship. I can tell just by the way he stands and talks. That child has not only grown in aura and physique but has also made significant progress in martial arts.<br><br>'What happened in the Room of Self?'<br><br>Swordsmen who enter the Room of Self break through their walls and advance to the next level, achieving overall growth. But Raon returned with improved physique, aura, and swordsmanship without breaking through a level. This was almost a unique case in Zieghart's history.<br><br>'He didn't break the wall, yet he became as strong as someone who did...You never cease to amaze me.'<br><br>Before entering the Room of Self, Raon was on par with Karoon and had similar martial prowess to the leaders of the Five Divine Orders, excluding the Thespian Emperor. But now, Raon seemed to be on a completely different level.<br><br>'He might not have reached the level of the Five Kings and Five Demons, but he's just below that.'<br><br>The Five Divine Orders are considered second to the Five Kings and Five Demons, but in reality, there's a significant power gap between the leaders of the two groups. The reason why the Five Divine Orders united in the first place was to survive among the Five Kings and Five Demons.<br><br>'He's my grandson, but I can't help but call him a monster.'<br><br>Raon has crossed more than half of that vast sea just by entering the Room of Self.<br><br>'It's still not enough, but with a bit more experience and power, he might reach it.'<br><br>Raon's martial prowess isn't enough to face the leaders of the Five Kings and Five Demons yet. However, it seemed he would reach that position in not too long.<br><br>'Hmm...'<br><br>Glenn narrowed his eyes as he watched Raon talking with Burren, Martha, and Runaan.<br><br>'The more I look at that child, the stranger I feel. It's as if my heart is being pricked...'<br><br>He couldn't pinpoint it exactly, but it seemed that not only Raon's martial prowess but also something in his soul had changed. A feeling of detachment from life and death, like a monk. A strange flow that even he hadn't yet attained seemed to swirl around Raon.<br><br>It was an eerie feeling that humans shouldn't possess, but it didn't feel particularly malicious. It was clearly an ability that would benefit Raon.<br><br>"Ahem!"<br><br>Glenn cleared his throat loudly after confirming the state of his grandson whom he hadn't seen in a while.<br><br>"Let's talk later."<br><br>As soon as Raon heard Glenn's cough, he turned away from his conversation with Burren, Martha, and Runaan and walked towards the platform.<br><br>"I greet you, Head of House."<br><br>Raon knelt and bowed, saying he had safely completed his journey and returned.<br><br>"It seems you've made quite a harvest."<br><br>Glenn nodded, not hiding the surprise and pride in his eyes.<br><br>"It's more than just a harvest..."<br><br>Karoon shook his head in disbelief.<br><br>"It's hard to believe even if you said you'd been training for over ten years."<br><br>He let out a hollow laugh, saying it was incomprehensible. It wasn't jealousy or envy, but rather difficulty in accepting such a massive change.<br><br>"As I passed through various tests prepared by the Room of Self, I found myself growing without realizing it."<br><br>Raon smiled faintly, recalling the tests he had undergone on the Sand Mountain.<br><br>"Various tests?"<br><br>"Wasn't it just one?"<br><br>Glenn and Karoon opened their eyes wide in surprise.<br><br>"Yes. First, I took a test to improve my physical strength, mental fortitude, and body by climbing a hot sand mountain without aura. Then, I had tests for swordsmanship and practical combat, and finally, a test to enhance my aura."<br><br>Raon explained the tests he had undergone in the Room of Self one by one. Of course, he omitted the parts about Wrath.<br><br>"...What kind of test did you take for swordsmanship?"<br><br>Karoon stepped closer, seemingly curious about the details of the test.<br><br>"I sparred with a golden-haired, red-eyed Swordsman who had mastered the Ten Thousand Swords. The method was..."<br><br>Raon explained the method of the test prepared by the First Patriarch without mentioning him specifically.<br><br>"So that's why I sense this sword aura from you now."<br><br>Karoon's fingers trembled on his sword hilt in amazement.<br><br>"Golden hair and red eyes...?"<br><br>Glenn leaned forward, seemingly more interested in the First Patriarch who had trained Raon than in the training method itself.<br><br>"Do you remember the sword of that Swordsman?"<br><br>"Yes. It had a silver blade with golden flame patterns. The shape of the sword was..."<br><br>Raon used his fingers to describe the sword of the First Patriarch he had seen in the Room of Self.<br><br>"So it was connected after all..."<br><br>Glenn nodded heavily, as if his doubts had been cleared. His lips trembled, and a flush crept into his cheeks.<br><br>"Head of House?"<br><br>Karoon blinked blankly, sensing Glenn's emotional change.<br><br>"Well, it seems I've asked too many questions. Right. You must be tired after training for such a long time, so you may go back for today."<br><br>Glenn waved his hand, saying they would talk again later.<br><br>"I understand."<br><br>Raon licked his lips thinly as he bowed his head to Glenn.<br><br>'As expected, the Head of House seems to know about the First Patriarch.'<br><br>Glenn, as the current head of Zieghart, seemed to have information about the First Patriarch as well.<br><br>-If you're done with the greetings, let's go quickly! I'm starving to death!<br><br>Wrath tapped on Raon's head, saying they should go back to the annex building and eat home-cooked food.<br><br>'Wait a moment, I still have something to say.'<br><br>Raon turned his gaze to Karoon standing on the left.<br><br>"You remember the promise I made before entering the Room of Self, right?"<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>Karoon nodded, suppressing the surprise in his eyes.<br><br>"When would you like to do it? I'm fine with tomorrow."<br><br>Raon clenched his fingertips, saying he wanted to test the achievements he had gained in the Room of Self.<br><br>"You're fine now, but fatigue will soon set in. Let's both get our bodies in top condition and face off next weekend."<br><br>Karoon waved his hand, suggesting they have their duel next week when they're in perfect condition.<br><br>"Understood."<br><br>After agreeing, Raon looked back at Glenn.<br><br>"Then I'll take my leave."<br><br>Raon bowed his head to Glenn and left the Lord's Manor with Burren, Martha, and Runaan.<br><br>"..."<br><br>"..."<br><br>Glenn and Karoon remained silent for a while, staring at the door of the audience chamber through which Raon had left.<br><br>"...He seems to have changed a lot."<br><br>Karoon bit his lip, clenching his fist.<br><br>'To the point where I can't win.'<br><br>His sense as a Transcendent told him. The Raon before entering the Room of Self and the current Raon were completely different people. Although there are many variables in a duel and the result can only be known after actually fighting, it was certain that the current Raon had surpassed his level.<br><br>"Yes. Exactly as you felt."<br><br>Glenn nodded calmly. He seemed pleased with Raon's growth, his lips trembling even more.<br><br>"By the way, who is this golden-haired, red-eyed man who appeared in Raon's test? Could it be someone from our family...?"<br><br>Karoon parted his lips, recalling Glenn's astonished expression.<br><br>"It was the First Patriarch."<br><br>Glenn nodded slowly.<br><br>"The, the First Patriarch..."<br><br>Thick veins bulged on Karoon's cheeks as if he was grinding his molars deeply.<br><br>"Now that we're at this point, I'll tell you..."<br><br>Glenn looked up at the ceiling of the audience chamber and let out a short breath.<br><br>"Raon's aura cultivation method is the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation was left behind by the First Patriarch. The cultivation method that had rejected everyone's touch for a thousand years chose Raon on its own."<br><br>He lowered his gaze, recalling the moment when the Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation came down and was grasped by Raon's hand. Now that Karoon's inferiority complex had completely disappeared, he wanted to share this long-held story.<br><br>"I see. So that's why..."<br><br>Karoon nodded heavily, as if he now understood Raon's growth and strength. He seemed disappointed, frustrated, and happy all at once.<br><br>"It's true that Raon has climbed to a higher place. He's surpassed your level too."<br><br>Glenn brought his two fingers together as he looked at where Raon had been standing.<br><br>"However, your path of the sword doesn't end here. There's no reason why you can't surpass him again."<br><br>"You don't need to comfort me. I know it's hard to catch up with a monster who grows every day."<br><br>Karoon swallowed hard, as if it wouldn't be easy.<br><br>"I'm not trying to comfort you."<br><br>Glenn shook his head firmly.<br><br>"The realm of Transcendence is mysterious. A novice who has been a Transcendent for less than a year can rise to the upper ranks, and a Martial Artist who has been at the bottom for decades can suddenly become a top-tier powerhouse."<br><br>He said that the realm of Transcendence is a world where common sense doesn't apply, and used his finger to draw a small dot in the air. The dot became a line, then a figure, and finally took the shape of a sharp sword.<br><br>"You can certainly do it now."<br><br>Glenn nodded calmly, as if he believed in Karoon.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Karoon pressed his lips tightly, seemingly moved by Glenn's sincere advice.<br><br>"I'll come see you again after my duel with Raon."<br><br>He bowed his head, saying he might have something to say after that, and left the audience chamber.<br><br>"..."<br><br>As soon as Karoon left the audience chamber, Glenn bowed his head deeply and trembled all over.<br><br>"Hehehe."<br><br>Roenn let out a hearty laugh as he stood below the platform.<br><br>"It seems we might have multiple causes for celebration."<br><br>He nodded, saying that good things were happening one after another.<br><br>"How..."<br><br>Glenn's voice trembled as if frustrated.<br><br>"How! Is it so amazing! To return successful again!"<br><br>He lifted both feet and let out the roar he had been holding back.<br><br>"And to be chosen by the First Patriarch! Indeed, he is my grandson!"<br><br>Glenn stomped his feet, as if Raon was too lovable.<br><br>"Hehehe..."<br><br>Roenn tried to block the sound and vibration with an aura barrier, but Glenn, overly excited, couldn't control his strength and caused a shock that seemed to bring down the Lord's Manor. The people in the Lord's Manor screamed and ran outside at the beastly sound.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>"Sorry, I'm a bit late."<br><br>Raon bowed his head to Burren, Martha, and Runaan.<br><br>"Just how much stronger have you become?"<br><br>Burren shrugged his shoulders curiously.<br><br>"That's right. Tell us! The Head of House and the Central Martial Palace Master's expressions were intense!"<br><br>Martha poked Raon's waist with her elbow, urging him to speak quickly.<br><br>"Did you... transcend Transcendence...?"<br><br>Runaan blinked her eyes, asking if he really surpassed Transcendence.<br><br>"It's true that I've become stronger, but definitely not to that extent."<br><br>Raon waved both hands, saying it was a misunderstanding.<br><br>"Then, perhaps to the level of the Five Kings and Five Demons..."<br><br>Martha approached with expectant eyes.<br><br>"Unfortunately, I haven't reached that level."<br><br>Raon shook his head firmly.<br><br>"I still can't win alone."<br><br>It's true that he had made great progress and blocked Wrath's attacks, but that was only possible because the same attack had been repeated a hundred times. If Wrath attacked in a different way, he certainly wouldn't be able to block it.<br><br>'That doesn't mean that time was meaningless.'<br><br>Not only did he grow in martial prowess, but he also gained something else. As living beings, it's natural to feel fear and terror when faced with death. Even the strongest Martial Artist can't display their full abilities, but Raon overcame fear and terror by dying a hundred times.<br><br>This surreal experience will be of great help in future wars, even more than martial prowess.<br><br>"I see..."<br><br>Martha licked her lips disappointedly. She still seemed to be worried about her mother who was captured by the Leader of the White Blood Religion.<br><br>"Oh! We also got permission to enter the Room of Self."<br><br>Burren waved his hand, saying they had received permission to enter the Room of Self from Glenn, as if trying to lighten the darkened mood.<br><br>"Thanks to you. I'm grateful."<br><br>"It's not because of me, but because of you all."<br><br>Raon shook his head. Without Burren, Martha, and Runaan, he wouldn't have been able to fight the Black Tower Master with peace of mind. The three of them were more than qualified to enter the Room of Self.<br><br>"Is there a bed in the Room of Self? Is it soft?"<br><br>Runaan seemed most curious about whether there was a bed in the Room of Self. It was a question befitting her sleepyhead nature.<br><br>"That's impossible to know. A different place appears for each person who enters."<br><br>Raon shook his head, saying one would only know after entering themselves.<br><br>"I think there will be one for you."<br><br>"Really?"<br><br>Runaan slightly waved her hand, seemingly happy just with that.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Raon clicked his tongue slightly as he watched the expressionless Runaan rejoice.<br><br>'There might be a bed, but it could become hell.'<br><br>Runaan's Room of Self might be comfortable, but it seemed like it would be a mentally very challenging place. It would probably be similar for Martha and Burren too.<br><br>"Ah, there's one more important thing."<br><br>Burren raised his hand.<br><br>-You shitty-eyes! Why are you talking so much today!<br><br>Wrath tapped on Raon's shoulder, saying to ignore them and go.<br><br>"What is it?"<br><br>Raon pushed Wrath away and nodded at Burren.<br><br>"The system for the Light Wind Palace hasn't been decided yet, right? Everyone's at a loss because you were gone even though the vacation is over."<br><br>Burren twirled his finger, saying they needed to decide on the system first.<br><br>"Don't worry about that. I've been thinking about it in the Room of Self. Not just the system, but the training will be really amazing."<br><br>Burren, Martha, and Runaan's faces turned pale at Raon's sinister smile.<br><br>"Happy, fun, and strengthening training. Everyone will love it."<br><br>Hearing his eerie voice, Burren, Martha, and Runaan slowly began to back away. A pressure that seemed to crush their souls. It was similar to the usual Raon, but something was different.<br><br>"Uh..."<br><br>"Damn it! This guy's starting again!"<br><br>"I'm going to sleep..."<br><br>Burren, Martha, and Runaan screamed and ran away.<br><br>"Why are they like that?"<br><br>Raon tilted his head as he watched the backs of the three.<br><br>-Look at your own expression and speak. You looked like a complete madman.<br><br>Wrath shook his head, saying Raon was the very image of an Angel.<br><br>'Don't swear.'<br><br>Raon chuckled and turned towards the annex building.<br><br>'My body feels light?'<br><br>Although he hadn't received the reward stat points yet, his body felt as light as a feather because both his physique and aura had grown.<br><br>'Shall I try it out?'<br><br>Usually, he would walk slowly, but wanting to test his newly strengthened martial prowess, he stomped his foot and took a Supreme Harmony Step. His vision narrowed and darkened with just one movement of his foot. <br><br>"Huh..."<br><br>Raon let out a hollow laugh after arriving in front of the annex building much faster than expected.<br><br>'I didn't expect it to be this different.'<br><br>The growth of his physique and aura, combined with the achievement of the Supreme Harmony Steps honed in the sea, created a speed that surprised even himself.<br><br>'This might be even stronger than I thought?'<br><br>It felt like addition meeting addition to create multiplication. It seemed he had returned even stronger than he had anticipated.<br><br>-I don't care how strong you are. What's important is what food we're having!<br><br>Wrath nodded, saying they should go in and decide on the dinner menu first.<br><br>'Is there something you want to eat?'<br><br>-Why ask! First, I want spicy pasta to forget the dryness of Nadine bread! Then, I want to moisten my tongue with the sweet and savory taste of pineapple pizza, followed by the concentrated umami of well-grilled beef...<br><br>Wrath kept talking endlessly as if Edgar's soul had possessed him.<br><br>'Alright, alright.'<br><br>Raon entered the annex building, letting Wrath's words flow past him. As soon as Raon entered the annex building, laughter and bustle filled the quiet afternoon annex. Soon after, the smoke rising from the chimney warmly reflected how happy this place was, like a mirror.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>"I'm back!"<br><br>Martha, as if out of habit, greeted as she entered the mansion of the Wise Martial Palace.<br><br>"Welcome back."<br><br>Denier, who was at the entrance, nodded with a soft smile.<br><br>"Oh? You're back?"<br><br>"The mission ended quite quickly."<br><br>Denier said he had just returned, brushing off the dust on his collar.<br><br>"Were you training at the great training ground before coming back?"<br><br>"No, I went to the Lord's Manor."<br><br>"The Lord's Manor?"<br><br>"Yes. I went to ask when Raon would return since he hadn't come out, and he just happened to come out."<br><br>Martha smiled, saying she had seen Raon and Glenn.<br><br>"I see. How was the Light Wind Palace Master?"<br><br>"To me, he seemed the same, but both the Head of House and the Central Martial Palace Master were surprised."<br><br>She let out a hollow laugh, recounting the conversation between Karoon and Glenn.<br><br>"Usually, one can only gain something significant from the Room of Self when facing a wall, but it seems he achieved remarkable results even though he just entered."<br><br>Martha waved her hand, saying he was an enviable guy.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Denier silently watched Martha chattering away with a doll-like smile.<br><br>"If the Head of House said so, it seems he really has made a lot of progress."<br><br>He said it was impressive, letting out a smile as if painted.<br><br>"That's right. Ah! I also got permission to enter the Room of Self."<br><br>Martha raised her hand, smiling.<br><br>"Of course, not now, but they said they'd let me enter when I face the wall of Transcendence..."<br><br>She bit her lip slightly, saying it seemed like it would take too long.<br><br>"You're thinking of your mother, aren't you?"<br><br>Denier nodded as if he could read Martha's mind completely.<br><br>"I'm sorry. I keep thinking about her..."<br><br>Martha nodded, saying she was sorry. Her eyes reddened slightly. It was an expression she only showed to Denier.<br><br>"What do you have to be sorry for?"<br><br>Denier slowly shook his head.<br><br>"Transcendence. It will certainly take a long time. However, there might be a way to shorten it a bit..."<br><br>He extended his hand with a warm smile.<br><br>"Would you like to try?"</p>
