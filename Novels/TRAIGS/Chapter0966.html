        <p>'Where...'<br><br>Raon left Wrath whining about food and checked the ability of the evolved trait , which had developed from . [: greatly enhances stealth abilities. If a sneak attack succeeds on an enemy while in stealth, even the smallest wound becomes fatal.]<br><br>-Huh? What?<br><br>Wrath's jaw dropped as soon as he read the description of the trait.<br><br>-What kind of insane trait is that! If it's as it says, even a tiny cut on a finger would become a fatal wound!<br><br>He shook his head vigorously, claiming it was impossible.<br><br>'It's not unconditional, only when a sneak attack succeeds.'<br><br>Specter isn't a trait that turns all attacks into fatal wounds. It's an assassin's ability that only transforms wounds into fatal ones when a sneak attack succeeds while in stealth.<br><br>'Of course, even that alone is an overpowered ability.'<br><br>Currently, Raon was confident he wouldn't lose to anyone except the leaders of the Five Kings and Demons and the transcendents of the previous era who had gone into seclusion. With his current strength, the existence of the trait, which could inflict fatal wounds on enemies through sneak attacks, would be a great help in future battles.<br><br>'Since it also enhances stealth abilities, there will be even more ways to use it.'<br><br>Because he didn't know the exact level of the Thespian Emperor's strength, he couldn't be absolutely certain of victory, but with this ability, he felt he could be confident of a 100% win rate against her.<br><br>'If I play it right, it might even work on The Fallen or the Leader of the White Blood Religion.'<br><br>Wrath's and Glenn's Aura Perception are extraordinary, so even if he activates Specter, surprising those two would be impossible. It probably wouldn't work on Derus or the Heavenly Demon either. But if used at the right moment, he might be able to inflict a fatal wound on The Fallen or the Leader of the White Blood Religion.<br><br>'It'll be more effective against The Fallen.'<br><br>The Fallen uses magic and sorcery, so his health is weaker compared to other transcendents. If he could inflict a fatal wound on him before starting the battle, he could lead the fight advantageously.<br><br>'Come to think of it, it really is an overpowered trait.'<br><br>In fact, sneak attacks are rarely effective in battles between highly skilled fighters. However, having lived his past life as an assassin, he was confident he could utilize the trait better than anyone else.<br><br>'It would have been better if it was related to swordsmanship, but this isn't bad either.'<br><br>He had hoped for a trait that would enhance his swordsmanship achievements, but he couldn't complain as this ability suited the name so well.<br><br>-You got that ability and you still want more?<br><br>Wrath exhaled in disbelief.<br><br>-You've been eating so well that you don't even realize the bread you're eating is made of gold! You spoiled brat!<br><br>He grabbed Raon's collar and shook him, telling him to come to his senses. Seeing his genuine anger, it seemed the trait had really upset him.<br><br>-Damn luck! Stupid system!<br><br>'I really gained a lot this time.'<br><br>Raon recalled everything he had gained since entering the Room of Self, ignoring Wrath.<br><br>'Even though there was no wall, it's not an exaggeration to say I've overcome a wall.'<br><br>By taking tests at each level, he had enhanced his mental strength, physical abilities, and swordsmanship achievements, understood the true usage of the Ten Thousand Swords, and upgraded both Ten Thousand Flames Cultivation and Glacier to 10 stars.<br><br>'And through sparring with Wrath, I also learned what death is.'<br><br>By dying 100 times to Wrath, he felt the presence of death and gained another overpowered trait called .<br><br>Specter for offense, Crisis Detection for defense. Thinking about it, he had gained crucial traits for both attack and defense.<br><br>'It's a bit embarrassing.'<br><br>Raon bit his lip slightly.<br><br>'I didn't expect this much of a reward.'<br><br>He had gained a lot while passing through the Room of Self, but he didn't expect to receive such additional rewards. This time, he felt almost sorry towards Wrath.<br><br>-......<br><br>Wrath was pressing his lips tightly while looking at the message, seemingly too angry even to curse. Seeing him not swearing, it seemed he was really upset.<br><br>'Alright, I get it.'<br><br>Raon got up from his chair and lightly patted Wrath's head.<br><br>'Let's go eat.'<br><br>It seemed like a lot of Wrath's Authority had been consumed in creating the abilities and traits, so he wanted to treat him to a good meal.<br><br>-......<br><br>However, contrary to his expectations, Wrath didn't follow immediately and instead furrowed his brow while lowering his gaze.<br><br>'Wrath?'<br><br>Raon, who was about to open the door, turned back and approached Wrath.<br><br>-Sigh...<br><br>Wrath let out a long sigh while looking at him. It seemed like fierce waves were crashing in his eyes.<br><br>'I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do. It's not like I asked for these rewards...'<br><br>Seeing Wrath in a worse mood than usual, he shook his head with his hands clasped.<br><br>-That's not it.<br><br>Wrath raised his gaze calmly, as if he had never been angry. His blue eyes shimmered brilliantly. Raon felt a chill down his spine, as if Wrath's true form that he had seen in the Room of Self had descended here.<br><br>-I was considering letting it go, but no matter how I think about it, I can't shake off this doubt.<br><br>Wrath clicked his tongue briefly, as if he couldn't help it.<br><br>'Doubt...?'<br><br>Raon asked, even though he sensed what Wrath was talking about.<br><br>-Without further ado...<br><br>Wrath jerked his chin towards the air.<br><br>-Bring up the beginning part of the reward message you showed earlier.<br><br>He gestured, asking to bring up the part that had been shown and boasted about several times.<br><br>'......'<br><br>Raon looked at the frost rising in Wrath's eyes and then brought up the message again.<br><br>[You have achieved growth in the Room of Self.]<br><br>[You have experienced 101 deaths.]<br><br>[All ability scores increase by 50 points.]<br><br>Wrath examined the message and calmly closed and opened his eyes.<br><br>-Indeed, this King was not mistaken.<br><br>He slowly turned his gaze to look at Raon.<br><br>-Look at the second message. Isn't 101 deaths strange?<br><br>Wrath pointed at the second message with his round hand.<br><br>-This King killed you ninety-nine times. You succeeded in defending at the last moment. Even if your death was counted when the space collapsed, it would be exactly 100 times.<br><br>He lowered his eyebrows, saying it couldn't be 101 no matter how you calculate it.<br><br>-Why is it 101 times?<br><br>Wrath briefly smacked his lips, telling him to explain.<br><br>'Hah...'<br><br>Raon exhaled a murky breath and brushed back the hair that had fallen over his forehead.<br><br>'So you noticed after all.'<br><br>He had thought it was strange when he first saw that message. He had died 99 times, and even if the last one was counted as a death, as Wrath said, it would only be 100 times.<br><br>'The last death. No, the first death was from my past life.'<br><br>The one death added to the hundred deaths was clearly when he died as the assassin Raon at the hands of Derus.<br><br>"Let me ask you one thing."<br><br>Raon briefly looked up at the ceiling and then lowered his gaze.<br><br>"Can the system know things that even you don't know?"<br><br>It was surprising that the system knew about his past life, which even Wrath hadn't figured out.<br><br>-Just looking at how it keeps mouthing off, you'd know that the one giving you rewards has its own will and special abilities that even this King doesn't have. Though it has no combat power...<br><br>Wrath turned his head, saying it's because of such abilities that it can transmit powers across dimensions.<br><br>"I see."<br><br>Although he didn't know exactly what kind of ability it was, unlike Wrath, the system seemed to know that he had died and reincarnated.<br><br>-......<br><br>Wrath fixed his gaze on him with his arms crossed, as if waiting for his answer.<br><br>'I could say I died when you weren't around, and it wouldn't be a problem.'<br><br>There were many dangerous situations during the tests, and he was far away from Wrath, so such an excuse might work.<br><br>'But I don't want to end this matter like that.'<br><br>Wrath was his confidant and closest friend. If he cut off his doubts with a lie, he might not be able to trust anyone in the future.<br><br>'I'll tell him. After I've taken my revenge on Derus.'<br><br>If Wrath heard about his past, he would become angry as if it were his own matter and try to forcefully draw out his power. Not wanting to see him coughing and collapsing anymore, he didn't want to bring up the story of his past life until he finished his revenge.<br><br>'I have to do this revenge with my own strength.'<br><br>He clenched his fist, determined to kill Derus with the anger and sword he had built up so far, and to destroy everything the bastard had built.<br><br>"I'll tell you when it's all over."<br><br>Raon promised Wrath, looking into his eyes, that he would soon tell him everything without hiding anything.<br><br>-Sigh...<br><br>Wrath looked into his eyes and let out a small sigh.<br><br>-If you say so, this King has no choice but to wait. Understood.<br><br>He smacked his lips, saying there was nothing he could do.<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>Raon smiled and sat down in the chair. He was really fortunate that Wrath was the demon king attached to him and his first friend.<br><br>-What are you doing now?<br><br>Wrath frowned as if he suddenly didn't like him.<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>-Why are you sitting down! Didn't you say we were going to eat!<br><br>He gritted his teeth, asking why he wasn't keeping his promise.<br><br>'I thought you weren't going to eat?'<br><br>-That's because I hadn't resolved my doubt. Now we need to eat!<br><br>Wrath raised his chin, telling him to go to the dining hall right away.<br><br>-Get going now!<br><br>'Hah...'<br><br>Raon let out a hollow laugh as he watched Wrath rubbing his plump belly.<br><br>'How can he not stay serious for even a minute?'<br><br>Raon shook his head and headed towards the dining hall.<br><br>'I wonder if this is really the same blue demon king who killed me 100 times...'<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>"That's right. It's better to lower the sword slowly there."<br><br>Raon smiled faintly as he adjusted Sia's sword stance.<br><br>"Speed, interval, direction, and the right application of martial arts principles are needed to maximize the power of swordsmanship."<br><br>He held Sia's hand and drew the Fangs of Insanity with her wooden sword. The brown wooden sword shimmered like the dawn moonlight, sharply cutting the surface of the lake as it fell gracefully. The waves of the lake couldn't fill the space cut by the wooden sword and rose into the air before slowly sinking back down.<br><br>"Wow..."<br><br>Sia opened her mouth in a round shape as she watched the lake slowly return to its original state.<br><br>"How about it? Do you get the feel?"<br><br>Raon shrugged his shoulders as he looked at Sia's sparkling eyes.<br><br>"No, I'll try it on my own!"<br><br>She said she would do it herself and swung the wooden sword alone. Sia's Fangs of Insanity fell fiercely, breaking the calm surface of the lake. Although the move itself was similar to his sword strike, it lacked direction due to excessive force, so it didn't reach its full power.<br><br>"It's difficult..."<br><br>Sia muttered that it wasn't working well and grabbed her head.<br><br>"It's natural for it to be difficult."<br><br>Raon shook his head with a smile. He had been practicing the Fangs of Insanity since his trainee days. Now it was one of his most confident sword techniques, so it was natural that Sia couldn't follow it easily.<br><br>"For now, don't think about my sword. Just focus on moving slowly at your own pace."<br><br>"Okay. I know."<br><br>Sia nodded calmly and raised her sword again.<br><br>"Judiel said I need to practice a lot to catch up with Raon."<br><br>She unleashed the Fangs of Insanity again, saying she would swing her sword every day just like him.<br><br>"Sis."<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he watched Sia practicing swordsmanship without getting discouraged.<br><br>"Why are you working so hard? Do you find swordsmanship fun?"<br><br>If she found it enjoyable because of her talent, it wouldn't be bad to take her to the Light Wind Palace and train her properly.<br><br>"It's fun. But..."<br><br>Sia looked at him with faintly shimmering eyes.<br><br>"You asked me before, remember? To protect the house while you were gone. To keep that promise, I need to get stronger."<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>She still remembered the promise he had made before leaving for his mission. An indescribable feeling welled up in his chest.<br><br>-Hmm...<br><br>Wrath also opened his eyes wide, as if surprised.<br><br>-It seems her mind has grown more than her swordsmanship.<br><br>He smiled approvingly, saying he couldn't see her as just a child anymore.<br><br>'Indeed.'<br><br>As Wrath said, it seemed he couldn't think of her as just a child anymore.<br><br>"Since you're working so hard, I should work harder too."<br><br>Raon nodded with a gentle smile.<br><br>"Are you going to train too, Raon?"<br><br>"Something like that."<br><br>"Will it take long?"<br><br>"No, I'll be back by dinner."<br><br>"Then I'll keep practicing swordsmanship. Let's eat together!"<br><br>Sia waved goodbye and focused on her swordsmanship again. Seeing her not clinging to him like before, it really seemed her mental age had increased. Raon turned his back, listening to the sound of Sia's sword wind.<br><br>'Just hearing that sound gives me confidence.'<br><br>Just having Sia smiling and training made him feel like a flame was burning in his chest. This seemed to be the existence and strength of family. Raon headed towards the main building, recalling Sia's eyes as she said she would protect the house. He entered the side path instead of the Lord's Manor and opened the door to the great training ground.<br><br>Inside the massive iron door, too large to see at a glance, four people were visible.<br><br>Glenn, Denier, Balder, and Karoon, whom he would be sparring with today. All the observers were gathered, except for Alice who hadn't woken up yet. Karoon placed his hand on his sword hilt upon seeing Raon. A fierce aura rose from his shoulders. He seemed to have entered a battle stance even though the sparring hadn't started yet.<br><br>'It ended ambiguously before. This time...'<br><br>Raon took a deep breath and walked towards Karoon.<br><br>'Let's win.'<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br><br>Karoon swallowed dry saliva as he watched Raon approaching with heavy steps.<br><br>'What is that...'<br><br>He knew Raon had become stronger after coming out of the Room of Self, as he had personally gone to the Lord's Manor to see it. But he never imagined that just approaching without holding a sword could create such pressure that constricted his breath. With each step Raon took, the pressure emanating from him intensified. It was so strong that he unconsciously placed his hand on his sword hilt, unable to withstand it without grabbing his sword.<br><br>'He's gone mad.'<br><br>He didn't know what he was looking at. It felt like a giant sword was approaching, not a person.<br><br>"You've really become a monster..."<br><br>He bit his lip and exhaled a heavy breath. Even without fighting, he already felt defeated. The absurdity made his jaw tremble involuntarily.<br><br><br>‘If I don’t go all out….’<br><br><br>Karoon deeply bit his molars as he stood before Raon, who seemed to have become a giant looking down on him.<br><br>'I might not even be able to withstand a single strike.'</p>
