        <p>-This isn't rigged, is it? How is this happening?<br><br>Wrath screamed, demanding to know why reward messages kept popping up every time he spoke.<br><br>-This accursed system must be watching my every move!<br><br>He gestured wildly at the empty air, demanding it to show itself.<br><br>'Should I check it out?'<br><br>Raon ignored Wrath's tantrum and examined the messages that appeared before him.<br><br>[You have bestowed the mercy of a Sword God upon those who will walk the same path.]<br><br>[Your mastery of Ten Thousand Swords has increased.]<br><br>[All abilities increase by 30 points.]<br><br>[The rank of the trait has increased.]<br><br>[The rank of the trait has increased.]<br><br>[The rank of the trait has increased.]<br><br>[The rank of the trait has increased.]<br><br>[Your realm of the soul has greatly increased.]<br><br>[A new trait has been created.]<br><br>'The rewards are nice, but the content is a bit embarrassing.'<br><br>The mention of Sword God was too burdensome for someone who had just reached Transcendence.<br><br>-That's what I'm saying!<br><br>Wrath slapped Raon's shoulder as if he had made a good point.<br><br>-The system likes you too much! When its master is right here!<br><br>He gritted his teeth, claiming that the system was so enamored with Raon's face that it couldn't think straight.<br><br>-I'll smash its head as soon as we return to Devildom!<br><br>'Is that so?'<br><br>Raon continued to examine the messages, ignoring Wrath's bestial growls.<br><br>[Your mastery of Ten Thousand Swords has increased.]<br><br>[All abilities increase by 30 points.]<br><br>'As expected, my mastery of Ten Thousand Swords has improved.'<br><br>As he had anticipated when his mental world expanded, the proficiency of all the sword techniques he had learned had grown. Since he had internalized them through his sparring with Briana, it was an even greater gain than just having vague insights.<br><br>'And all my abilities increased by 30 points.'<br><br>Despite facing two Transcendents, Raon felt like he had gained these points effortlessly. The Thespian Emperor had merely unleashed her aura and magic in a state of mental collapse, while the sparring with Briana had been mutually beneficial in many ways.<br><br>-You barely did anything, and you get 30 points? This isn't a marketplace, why is it giving away so much!<br><br>Wrath yelled at the system, begging it to come to its senses.<br><br>'Next...'<br><br>Raon felt strength and vitality surging through his body as he checked the messages below.<br><br>[The rank of the trait has increased.]<br><br>[The rank of the trait has increased.]<br><br>[The rank of the trait has increased.]<br><br>[The rank of the trait has increased.]<br><br>'Four traits have improved as well.'<br><br>The rank of had increased, probably because he had focused on his eye power to break down Briana's swordsmanship. had also improved from enduring the Thespian Emperor's aura and magic. The traits of and , seemed to have grown along with his mastery of Ten Thousand Swords.<br><br>-This is driving me crazy! You just ate from a prepared table, why are you getting four upgrades!<br><br>Wrath trembled, shaking his fists that were curled up like bread rolls, claiming it was becoming increasingly unbearable.<br><br>'He's having a worse fit than usual today.'<br><br>Raon pushed away Wrath, who was flailing about with all his might like a tadpole, and checked the last message.<br><br>[Your realm of the soul has greatly increased.]<br><br>[A new trait has been created.]<br><br>'Spirit Transformation?'<br><br>As the name alone didn't allow for any guesses, he immediately checked its contents. : A soul that has grown so large it transcends its physical vessel, exerting a positive influence on those around it.<br><br>'Does this mean my soul has a beneficial effect on others?'<br><br>Reading the description of Spirit Transformation, it seemed to imply that my soul, which had grown disproportionately large for his current level, would create positive effects for others.<br><br>-Tch...<br><br>Unlike his reactions to the other reward messages, Wrath only clicked his tongue briefly.<br><br>'Why aren't you getting angry for once?'<br><br>Raon lightly tapped Wrath's tail, asking if he had finally matured.<br><br>-Because I knew it was coming.<br><br>Wrath smacked his lips as if he had anticipated the trait.<br><br>'You knew?'<br><br>-That's right.<br><br>He nodded calmly.<br><br>-Didn't you find it strange that both wenches you fought today fell into a state of enlightenment?<br><br>Wrath pointed at Briana, who was still in a trance-like state.<br><br>'Hmm...'<br><br>Raon let out a low groan as he followed Wrath's hand to look at Briana.<br><br>-It's true that the heaven's flow wench had been in a deep mental state for a long time, and that crazy wench's soul is special, so they both easily entered a state of enlightenment. But even so...<br><br>He narrowed his eyes deeply.<br><br>-It's impossible for them to fall into a trance immediately after fighting you.<br><br>Wrath shook his head, saying that no matter what circumstances there might be, it was beyond the norm for two people to enter a state of enlightenment just from sparring with someone.<br><br>'Then...'<br><br>Raon swallowed dryly as he looked at the newly created trait .<br><br>-That's right.<br><br>Wrath lowered his hand as if to confirm it.<br><br>-The King wasn't sure when it happened with the heaven's flow wench, but now it's certain.<br><br>He nodded his chin towards Raon.<br><br>-You've instinctively figured out how to use that enormous soul of yours while opening your Soul Sword.<br><br>'Using my soul...?'<br><br>-Your soul is of such high caliber that not only the King, but even that old geezer Nadine would acknowledge it. Now it's affecting not just yourself, but others as well. That damn Ring of Fire's power probably plays a part too.<br><br>Wrath lowered his eyebrows, saying that this effect had simply been manifested as a trait.<br><br>'I see.'<br><br>Raon said he understood now and looked back at the Spirit Transformation trait.<br><br>'This is quite... no, an incredibly huge gain, isn't it?'<br><br>Being able to use his soul to help others grow - this ability would clearly be more beneficial to the Light Wind Palace's growth than any other trait.<br><br>'I'm looking forward to this.'<br><br>Raon curled his lips into a smile as he looked at the Light Wind Palace swordsmen.<br><br>"Palace Master!"<br><br>"Well done!"<br><br>"We believed you would win!"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen waved their hands and cheered in response to Raon's smile.<br><br>"Urgh!"<br><br>However, Dorian, who could read Raon's thoughts, covered his mouth as if about to vomit and trembled from head to toe.<br><br>"We're doomed..."<br><br>***<br><br>"Hah!"<br><br>Just as Raon was thinking about how to help the Light Wind Palace swordsmen grow, Briana, who had been in a state of enlightenment, opened her eyes with a deep exhale.<br><br>'She woke up faster than expected.'<br><br>Perhaps because it wasn't her own ability but a trance induced by his influence, she hadn't spent much time in her mental world.<br><br>"M-Master!"<br><br>"Are you alright?"<br><br>The Unyielding Blade swordsmen guarding Briana rushed to her side.<br><br>"I'm in the best condition I've ever been."<br><br>Briana waved off her subordinates, saying her body and mind were completely refreshed, and approached Raon.<br><br>"I suppose I should thank you first."<br><br>She bowed politely, expressing gratitude for the insight she had gained. It seemed she was thanking him for entering a state of enlightenment during their sparring, unaware of the Spirit Transformation.<br><br>"It was just a coincidence."<br><br>Raon waved his hand, looking into Briana's now serene eyes.<br><br>"Why the sudden formality?"<br><br>Briana tilted her head, finding it strange.<br><br>"Because our sparring is over."<br><br>Raon shrugged, saying he no longer needed to act arrogant now that he had achieved his goal.<br><br>"I've felt it since I first saw you, but you truly are peculiar."<br><br>Briana chuckled as she looked at him.<br><br>"Never mind the way of speaking, now please tell me. Who are you?"<br><br>Raon said that since the sparring was over, she should explain everything now.<br><br>"I'm the older sister of the woman you call the Queen of Swords."<br><br>Briana pointed at her own chest with her finger.<br><br>"Twin sisters born in one body."<br><br>She smiled, saying that two souls coexisted in a single body.<br><br>"Is it like a split personality?"<br><br>"You could think of it that way, but it's not really. Our souls are truly different."<br><br>Briana shook her head with a smile.<br><br>"Ah, I see."<br><br>It seemed that, as he had initially sensed, it wasn't a change in personality but a switch between souls.<br><br>"Brigitte and I would involuntarily switch control of the body since birth, regardless of our will. We were pointed at as cursed and even abandoned by our parents."<br><br>Briana let out a faint laugh, saying that after being abandoned by their parents, they coincidentally met a master and joined the Unyielding Blade.<br><br>"Don't say that? I promised, so it's right to tell everything."<br><br>She waved her hand as if telling Brigitte to stay quiet.<br><br>"What do you mean by constantly switching?"<br><br>"It means our souls would switch at random times, not like now where we can change at will. The physical and mental pain was so severe that we truly thought we'd go mad."<br><br>Briana exhaled a heavy breath, saying that when their souls forcibly switched, the shock was so intense that they would faint.<br><br>"That's when our master introduced us to Ariel. Thanks to the magic she cast on us, we were able to live like this."<br><br>She brushed back her disheveled hair, saying they were able to survive thanks to the Thespian Emperor's magic. Now he understood why the Queen of Swords had followed the Thespian Emperor.<br><br>"Of course, the Ariel of that time probably saved us because she read the heaven's flow and thought we might be useful. But still, she did help us."<br><br>Briana smiled softly, as if she had read all aspects of the Thespian Emperor's personality.<br><br>"I have one question. You're much stronger, so why was Brigitte in control of the body?"<br><br>Raon asked Briana about something he had been curious about.<br><br>"I chose to go inside."<br><br>Briana placed her hand on her chest as if holding Brigitte's hand.<br><br>"It's natural for an older sister to take care of her younger sibling, isn't it?"<br><br>She smiled, saying it wasn't a difficult choice.<br><br>"...I see."<br><br>Raon let out a sigh as he looked at Briana, who didn't seem to regret her decision.<br><br>'She's a person of great character.'<br><br>Seeing her smile and make the choice for her sister without regret, even though she had already tasted having a physical body, Raon could sense the vastness of Briana's character.<br><br>'This person will grow even more in the future.'<br><br>He was looking forward to seeing the truly different level of martial prowess and growth she would show if she could overcome the limitations of Brigitte's body and aura.<br><br>"What? Even if I was born just one minute earlier, I'm still the older sister! And it doesn't matter whether I speak out loud or inside!"<br><br>Briana furrowed her brow as if arguing with Brigitte inside.<br><br>"Was Brigitte's reticence because..."<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he looked at Briana.<br><br>"That's right. She seems quiet because she's chatting with me inside."<br><br>She laughed, saying that Brigitte was actually quite talkative.<br><br>"Can I ask you something too?"<br><br>Briana raised a finger.<br><br>"Go ahead."<br><br>"You can enter the mental world at will, can't you?"<br><br>She smiled faintly as if she had sensed it.<br><br>"Not entirely at will, but I can somewhat time it."<br><br>Raon shook his head, saying that entering the mental world wasn't that difficult.<br><br>"I knew it! I felt a similar rhythm from you while we were fighting!"<br><br>Briana grinned, saying she had sensed a similar quality while fighting him.<br><br>"Similar rhythm?"<br><br>"I can sever the connection with my body and enter the mental world. I've been training alone in that space until now."<br><br>She nodded, saying she had been honing her footwork and swordsmanship in that solitary space.<br><br>"...I see."<br><br>Raon swallowed dryly as he looked at Briana.<br><br>'So that's how she could display such impossibly refined techniques and footwork.'<br><br>It seemed that while Brigitte handled external affairs, Briana had been training her sword techniques and footwork in the mental world where time flowed more slowly, creating swordsmanship and footwork refined enough to pose a threat to him. Now all the questions he had about her were answered.<br><br>"I really enjoyed fighting with you."<br><br>Briana extended her fist, saying they should spar again sometime.<br><br>"Anytime."<br><br>Raon smiled faintly and raised his hand to bump fists with Briana.<br><br>"I'm all for walking the same path as Zieghart."<br><br>Briana said she would agree to follow the Five Kings, then closed her eyes. When she opened them again, the soul of the original owner, Brigitte, was reflected in them.<br><br>"Umm..."<br><br>The Queen of Swords, Brigitte, bit her lip slightly as she looked at him. She seemed embarrassed that all their hidden facts had been revealed.<br><br>"First, I should thank you. Not just Briana, but I was also affected."<br><br>She nodded, implying that she had also entered the state of enlightenment when Briana did.<br><br>"And..."<br><br>Brigitte exhaled briefly and nodded.<br><br>"I agree with my sister."<br><br>She extended her fist, saying she had decided to join the Five Kings like Briana.<br><br>"I apologize for my many discourtesies today."<br><br>Raon bowed his head, saying he was sorry for his rudeness.<br><br>"I look forward to working with you."<br><br>He said he would ensure they wouldn't regret it, and extended his hand towards the fist that was the same yet different. Their fists met with a soft thud.<br><br>***<br><br>Raon returned to the Thespian Emperor's training ground with Brigitte.<br><br>"You've returned."<br><br>The Thespian Emperor, who seemed to have regained consciousness in the meantime, bowed politely with her hand on her chest.<br><br>"You look pleased."<br><br>Raon smiled gently as he looked into the Thespian Emperor's eyes, which were slowly lifting.<br><br>'She's back.'<br><br>The Thespian Emperor's eyes were gleaming with an intellectual light that he hadn't seen today. Her very presence seemed to shine more vividly and elegantly than when he first saw her in Zieghart. It appeared that not only had she emerged from her mental state, but her realm of the soul had also greatly increased.<br><br>"Of course I'm pleased. I've escaped from that narrow room that was confining me."<br><br>The Thespian Emperor clasped her hands in front of her, thanking him for freeing her from the dark and cramped room.<br><br>"Brigitte. You seem to have changed as well."<br><br>She smiled gently at the Queen of Swords standing behind Raon.<br><br>"Yes. I'm indebted to this guy. Both me and Briana."<br><br>The Queen of Swords smacked her lips, saying it was a debt that would be hard to repay.<br><br>"So we've decided to join the Five Kings."<br><br>She nodded, indicating that the decision had already been made.<br><br>"I see. Then we should settle accounts first."<br><br>"Settle accounts..."<br><br>Raon chuckled as he watched the Thespian Emperor approach him.<br><br>'It's fascinating how quickly she changes.'<br><br>It was surprising how she had been willing to follow the Five Kings without question until just now, but as soon as she regained her senses, she wanted to settle accounts first. However, this was more like the Thespian Emperor he knew, so he decided to accept it. In fact, he hadn't expected to receive the Five Divine Orders for free.<br><br>"Of course, I don't intend to use the Five Divine Orders without compensation. First..."<br><br>"That's not what I meant."<br><br>The Thespian Emperor took another step forward just as he was about to explain what he had in mind.<br><br>"You've provided a new light for me, who was slowly being buried. Therefore, White Whale and I will follow Zieghart until the war with the Five Demons ends."<br><br>The Thespian Emperor nodded, expressing her firm decision as if she had already made up her mind.<br><br>"We'll discuss any rewards or promises after the war ends, during the distribution of merits."<br><br>She smiled faintly, saying she would receive any contractual money or promises later.<br><br>"Do you really mean that?"<br><br>Raon frowned as he looked at the Thespian Emperor's smile.<br><br>"We could discard the Five Divine Orders after the war ends."<br><br>"They say the hand that gives roses retains their fragrance. Perhaps because of the insight I gained thanks to you, I've come to understand a bit about what kind of person you are."<br><br>The Thespian Emperor nodded, saying she had sensed his soul when she fell into the state of enlightenment.<br><br>"I'm certain that even if I die in the war, you'll pass on appropriate compensation to White Whale. From now on, the Five Divine Orders will stand with Zieghart."<br><br>She bowed her head, mentioning Zieghart's name rather than the Five Kings, as if to show her trust in him.<br><br>"I look forward to working with you, Sword Emperor Raon Zieghart."</p>
