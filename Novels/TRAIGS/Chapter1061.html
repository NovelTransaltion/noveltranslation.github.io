        <p>With a fierce cry, Raon swung the Heavenly Drive towards Denier's heart in a world of high-speed precision where he could feel mana particles touching his skin. The blade's flames rotated violently as they descended.<br><br>"Ugh!"<br><br>Unlike before, Denier couldn't dodge with ease. He twisted his body forcefully to deflect Raon's sword strike. He seemed to still disbelieve that they had entered the same realm.<br><br>"The longer you take to accept it, the harder it'll be."<br><br>Raon smirked as he moved to Denier's left, unleashing the Silver Wind Vortex of the Blizzard Sword Art with the Heavenly Drive, while simultaneously executing the Flame and Ice Unification with the Blade of Requiem. A frigid wind of frost fell from the sky, while waves of flame rose from the earth, engulfing Denier.<br><br>"I'll aim for your neck directly."<br><br>Sensing his escape routes blocked, Denier charged straight at Raon instead. His judgment was quick, and his movement swift. Denier's swordsmanship accelerated even further. It seemed his full power hadn't been revealed until now.<br><br>Raon frowned as he deflected Denier's sword aimed at his neck with the Heavenly Drive.<br><br>"Speed alone won't be enough to defeat me."<br><br>Though Denier was still moving too fast to be seen, his movements were deeply etched in Raon's mind like an afterimage. Having fully grasped Denier's martial arts and habits, blocking or dodging his sword wasn't particularly difficult.<br><br>"Don't spout nonsense."<br><br>Denier's previously calm demeanor shattered as he gritted his teeth and swung his sword upwards, aiming for Raon's legs. His swordsmanship became sharper and faster, but with his composure lost, reading his moves became easier. Raon deployed the Fire Wall with the Heavenly Drive to block Denier's strike, then thrust forward with the Blade of Requiem.<br><br>The blade, imbued with resentment, cut through the thick bloody energy and sliced Denier's waist. White blood spurted from the gash in Denier's uniform and waist.<br><br>"Ugh..."<br><br>Though Denier's wound immediately closed due to his immense bloody energy, he deeply furrowed his brow, seemingly in intense pain and anger.<br><br>"You've heard it too, right? The resentment in this sword is deeper and darker than the sea."<br><br>Raon flicked Denier's white blood off the Blade of Requiem as he raised his chin.<br><br>"It will never lose to your crude bloody energy."<br><br>Vowing to burn everything of the White Blood Religion along with the resentment of the Blade of Requiem, Raon stepped forward with the Supreme Harmony Steps.<br><br>"The resentment of the dead holds no value."<br><br>Denier, as if determined never to die, stomped the ground heavily and swung his sword. His sword strike extended like a long spear, piercing towards Raon's chest.<br><br>'Did he combine swordsmanship and footwork with the principles of Quick Sword?'<br><br>Due to the incredible speed of his swordsmanship and footwork, Denier's sword appeared to stretch out like the horizon.<br><br>'I've learned another one.'<br><br>Thinking he should use this when creating a new sword technique, Raon deployed Frost Snap against Denier's sword thrusting towards his heart. With a blade of frost and silver connected like a single line, he deflected Denier's sword and counterattacked, tearing into his shoulder with the Blade of Requiem.<br><br>"Ugh!"<br><br>Denier stepped back, clutching his shoulder where flesh had been torn away. His eyes trembled, seemingly in confusion.<br><br>"How is this..."<br><br>"You mean you don't understand why you're losing even though you're faster, right?"<br><br>Raon nodded, indicating he understood completely.<br><br>"The answer is simple. I'm reading all your movements."<br><br>Perhaps because so many lives were at stake, Raon's concentration had reached a level that surprised even himself, allowing him to fully grasp Denier's swordsmanship and movements. Having nearly mastered the principles of Precise Sword and Quick Sword, there were no areas where he was inferior to Denier now.<br><br>'It's probably because Forever Unrippled Mind has activated.'<br><br>While most people tense up and make mistakes in life-or-death situations, Raon could remain calm and move more freely in dangerous situations thanks to his Forever Unrippled Mind trait.<br><br>"Impossible..."<br><br>Denier's jaw trembled, as if he couldn't believe all his moves had been read.<br><br>-Though he's a traitor, I can understand that feeling of despair.<br><br>Wrath chuckled, saying he could relate to Denier's emotions.<br><br>-You're becoming a true monster.<br><br>He nodded, saying Raon was becoming somewhat worthy of recognition even in terms of martial prowess.<br><br>"Now, let's end this..."<br><br>As Raon was about to bring down the Heavenly Drive on Denier, he turned his gaze towards a powerful sound of air being torn from the right. The Transcendents of the Five Kings were visible, their legs planted firmly on the ground as they faced the bloody energy of the Leader of the White Blood Religion.<br><br>"Hold on! Hold on even if it kills you!"<br><br>"I... I know..."<br><br>Lecross swung his sword with his mouth tightly shut, black blood flowing from it, while Larian, seemingly reverted to a reclusive magician, trembled her blood-soaked hands as she erected a wall of mana with only six daggers remaining.<br><br>"Haa..."<br><br>"Let's try a bit more..."<br><br>Alice slashed through space with her strength-drained hands, while Chamber, his internal injuries seemingly flaring up again, formed magic formulas as blood flowed from his eyes. Both of them were now focused solely on evasion and defense, unable to launch attacks.<br><br>"Phew! They're all dying! All dying!"<br><br>Evelyn activated dozens of magic circles with time delays, twisting the weapons of the Godly Blood Summoning Ritual falling towards the Transcendents of the Five Kings. If she hadn't been helping, they would all have died already.<br><br>"Your resistance is meaningless!"<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion chanted a spell with her lips moving so fast they were invisible, her hands clasped together. The ground beneath her feet boiled like lava, raising a massive tidal wave of blood that seemed to reach the sky.<br><br>As the wave slowly tilted towards the Transcendents of the Five Kings, a chilling sensation crept up Raon's spine, as if he were witnessing the moment of the world's end.<br><br>"You seem to enjoy water games!"<br><br>"We should ride a wave of this size!"<br><br>Lecross and Chamber swung their swords and unleashed magic as if welcoming the challenge, their hands trembling. Alice and Larian stood beside them, unleashing spatial swords and magic that erased bloody energy.<br><br>"I'm the busiest one here thanks to picking a good man!"<br><br>Evelyn spread her mana widely, creating a magical wall capable of blocking the wave of bloody energy itself. However, the Leader of the White Blood Religion's bloody energy was so strong that the wall she created cracked in dozens of places within seconds.<br><br>The Transcendents of the Five Kings barely held on, breathing shallow breaths, but the situation was dire enough that they could die at any moment.<br><br>"If you have nothing more to show..."<br><br>Raon pressed his lips tightly as he turned his gaze back to Denier.<br><br>"Let's end this."<br><br>He stepped forward with the Supreme Harmony Steps, utilizing the awakened principles of Quick Sword. Catching up to the retreating Denier, he slashed down with the Heavenly Drive and thrust forward with the Blade of Requiem. Denier blocked the Heavenly Drive by swinging his sword diagonally downward, but couldn't avoid the Blade of Requiem and was stabbed in the chest, rolling on the ground.<br><br>"Urgh!"<br><br>He retreated to the left, using his bloody energy to heal the wounds on his shoulder and chest. Raon unleashed the Fire Spirit towards Denier, who was focused on escaping. A garden of flames bloomed above the red-hot blade, scattering thousands of petals. The dancing fragments of flame in the air became a firestorm that engulfed Denier.<br><br>"Tch!"<br><br>Denier opened his bloody energy and wrapped it around his entire body like a long robe to block the firestorm. Raon didn't miss the opportunity when Denier's steps faltered and rushed in, slashing Denier's back lengthwise with the Heavenly Drive. Sticky blood poured from the gaping wound.<br><br>"Urgh!"<br><br>Denier let out a murky groan. As he tried to break through the Fire Spirit with his body, Raon simultaneously detonated over a thousand flame fragments. An enormous shockwave erupted, shaking the ground and sending black smoke rising into the sky. The White Blood Religion Headquarters began to tilt further towards the sea.<br><br>Denier fled to the right while regenerating the wound on his back. The effects of the White Blood seemed to have diminished significantly, as his wound healing speed had noticeably slowed.<br><br>"Are you a thief rather than a swordsman? You're quite good at running away."<br><br>Raon deployed the Azure Sky Sword and Celestial Thunder Arts to block Denier's escape route, then plunged a sword strike like red lightning down onto Denier's head. Denier's waist and thighs were torn apart, revealing wounds deep enough to expose bone.<br><br>"Argh!"<br><br>Despite screaming in pain, he managed to heal his wounds and flee again.<br><br>"You've reached your limit."<br><br>Denier's movements had slowed as if his bloody energy was depleted, and he was spewing white blood from his nose and mouth. It seemed he had reached the physical limit the Leader of the White Blood Religion had mentioned.<br><br>"Stop wasting time and die..."<br><br>Just as Raon was about to behead Denier with Sword Control, an enormous explosion of bloody energy from the Leader of the White Blood Religion sent the Transcendents of the Five Kings and Evelyn crashing to the ground.<br><br>"Playtime is over."<br><br>She unleashed her original bloody energy and the weapons of the Godly Blood Summoning Ritual simultaneously, as if to end it all now. The massive energy caused violent tremors that seemed to flip the sky and earth.<br><br>"Damn it..."<br><br>Raon abandoned his attack on Denier and rushed towards the Transcendents of the Five Kings.<br><br>'They can't block that with just the five of them.'<br><br>Normally, Larian, Chamber, and Lecross could easily block it, but now the three of them had reached their limit, even more so than Denier. Evelyn, too, seemed incapable of doing anything, exhausted from supporting the Transcendents.<br><br>"R-Raon!"<br><br>"It's dangerous!"<br><br>Chamber and Lecross quickly gestured for him to come behind them.<br><br>"You came to help me? As expected!"<br><br>Evelyn, on the contrary, grinned as if she had been waiting for him.<br><br>"I'll block from the front, please help me!"<br><br>Instead of saying he'd handle it alone, Raon shouted for help as he stood in front of everyone. He simultaneously fired the Flame Dragon Strike and Heavy Sky Cannon, his most powerful techniques, towards the bloody energy of the Leader of the White Blood Religion and the Godly Blood Summoning Ritual that was advancing, crushing the ground.<br><br>The dragon's breath from the Heavenly Drive and the blue flash from the Blade of Requiem extended from the sword strikes, colliding head-on with the Leader of the White Blood Religion's bloody energy.<br><br>As the aura and bloody energy fiercely competed, black cracks that seemed to tear the world apart stretched from sky to ground.<br><br>'It feels like my arms are going to fall off...'<br><br>Raon clenched his jaw so hard his teeth might break. Though only a second had passed, he felt pressure as if his bones and muscles were being crushed. His internal organs contracted, causing blood to spurt from his mouth.<br><br>'How can I endure this... Ah!'<br><br>Just as he was wondering how to hold on, the magic and aura from the Transcendents of the Five Kings behind him helped push back the bloody energy. He could barely breathe again.<br><br>'We can't keep blocking. We need to attack.'<br><br>He deployed the Wooden Ring Sword with Sword Control, then used Whispering Wind against the violently approaching bloody energy. The Wooden Ring Sword, imbued with green wind, pierced through space and emerged in front of the Leader of the White Blood Religion's neck.<br><br>"Hmph!"<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion stepped back swiftly, as if determined not to be caught twice, but the Whispering Wind, harmonized with the principles of Quick Sword, followed her movements and grazed the tip of her neck. About a third of the Leader of the White Blood Religion's neck was torn, causing transparent blood to gush out like a fountain.<br><br>Thanks to her concentration being broken, the bloody energy that was about to erase them also subsided.<br><br>"Ugh..."<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion gritted her teeth audibly as she erased the wound on her neck.<br><br>"You vermin!"<br><br>She created wrinkles like tree bark above her forehead, seemingly truly enraged.<br><br>"Huff... Huff..."<br><br>Raon moved the Wooden Ring Sword again while exhaling roughly.<br><br>'I need to kill Denier now.'<br><br>Thanks to the Five Kings' leaders holding out, the Leader of the White Blood Religion no longer possessed the invincible bloody energy she had when she first drank the White Blood. He needed to deal with Denier first before the situation deteriorated further with his involvement.<br><br>'Where is he... Huh?'<br><br>Raon gasped as he turned his gaze to search for Denier.<br><br>'What the!'<br><br>Denier hadn't fled far. He was kneeling beside a collapsed building, scooping up blood pooled on the ground with both hands and drinking it.<br><br>'That blood puddle is...'<br><br>The blood pooled on the floor was from the large amount of blood that had poured from Lecross's back, forming a small puddle. Denier was frantically inhaling the dirt and Lecross's blood.<br><br>No, not just Lecross's blood. Denier was shoving the blood he and the other Five Kings' leaders had spilled, along with dirt, down his throat. This wasn't an act to gain power and become stronger, but a desperate attempt to survive at all costs.<br><br>'Insane...'<br><br>The hair on Raon's body stood on end. Denier's fanatical attachment to life sent a chilling sensation down his spine, as if he were walking barefoot on ice.<br><br>-Was, was that guy always like this?<br><br>Even Wrath lowered his eyebrows, saying this didn't seem like Denier.<br><br>'I have to kill him!'<br><br>An alarm bell rang in Raon's mind, warning of danger. Not knowing what Denier might do, he launched the Wooden Ring Sword with Sword Control.<br><br>"Urgh!"<br><br>But Denier avoided the Sword Control even as he rolled on the ground, then licked up blood from another spot on the ground with his tongue.<br><br>"Yes. Survive by any means necessary."<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion nodded as if approving, then swung down the weapons held by the Godly Blood Summoning Ritual, imbued with bloody energy. Raon deployed Sky-Piercing Thunder and Dance of the Golden Flame to block the Leader of the White Blood Religion's offensive.<br><br>Even with the Five Kings' leaders supporting from behind and Evelyn casting defensive magic, Raon's feet began to sink into the ground.<br><br>'I have to hold on!'<br><br>Though his body and mind were on the verge of collapse, he could barely block thanks to the growth of his martial prowess and soul due to Denier. If he hadn't grown here, he would have burst into a red mist at the Leader of the White Blood Religion's first attack.<br><br>'There's no chance to target Denier.'<br><br>Though Raon wanted to deal with Denier decisively, the Leader of the White Blood Religion gave him no opportunity. He had no choice but to focus solely on the monster before him.<br><br>'The Leader of the White Blood Religion will weaken soon too.'<br><br>Just as Denier had lost his strength, the Leader of the White Blood Religion would also face the backlash from the White Blood. He had to hold out until then, even if it meant pouring out his entire soul.<br><br>"Ugh..."<br><br>Unlike Denier, however, the Leader of the White Blood Religion's martial prowess didn't subside easily. With each block of her attacks, Raon's flesh was torn away and his internal injuries deepened. Like the other Five Kings' leaders, black, dead blood spurted from his mouth.<br><br>"You're holding on well, like cockroaches!"<br><br>Veins bulged on the Leader of the White Blood Religion's forehead, seemingly irritated by the situation not going as she wished.<br><br>"Fine. There's no point in holding back, I'll crush you thoroughly!"<br><br>As she clasped her hands and rapidly chanted a spell, white bloody energy began to rise like a fireball, shimmering with heat haze. The sphere of bloody energy swelled endlessly, rising into the sky like a new sun.<br><br>The Godly Blood Summoning Ritual, as if inheriting the Leader of the White Blood Religion's anger, changed the red blood flowing from its eyes to white and simultaneously raised dozens of weapons.<br><br>A powerful aura that seemed to strangle the soul emanated from the variously curved arms and weapons. The harmony of the white sun blazing with bloody energy and the dozens of weapons moving with masterful subtlety exuded a majestic presence that seemed unblockable by anyone.<br><br>"Ha!"<br><br>Chamber let out a hollow laugh as she dropped the lollipop she had been holding in her mouth.<br><br>"To think she was still hiding such power..."<br><br>Lecross exhaled deeply, as if saying this looked difficult.<br><br>"Ah, there was still so much to research, and the sea spirits too..."<br><br>Larian muttered about unfinished experiments, as if death was now visible.<br><br>"Damn it! I should have honed my sword more!"<br><br>Alice gritted her molars, regretting not training harder.<br><br>"It's light compared to the hardships Raon and I have been through."<br><br>Evelyn grinned, saying they could certainly overcome this.<br><br>"It's not over yet."<br><br>Raon walked towards the slowly descending sun of bloody energy, holding the Blade of Requiem with both hands.<br><br>'I wanted to save this, but there's no choice.'<br><br>If he didn't use his last resort now, he and everyone here would die. He had to use the sword technique he had been saving for last. Stomping the ground hard enough to crush it, he swung the Blade of Requiem, raising flames of resentment. Sword Domain. Heaven's Rift. An endless golden radiance rose above the red blade of the Blade of Requiem.<br><br>That brilliant light, like the sun pushing away the night and bringing the morning, erased the ugly bloody energy and emitted a warm yet magnificent aura.<br><br>"If the youngster is going this far, we can't just stand by!"<br><br>"..."<br><br>Chamber operated dimensional magic while coughing blood, and Lecross swung his sword burning with an ashen light, conserving even the strength to speak.<br><br>"Hnngh..."<br><br>"Haaaa!"<br><br>Larian poured all the remaining mana into her broken staff and daggers before throwing them, while Alice thrust her spatial sword with a scream that seemed to pour out her soul.<br><br>"I really picked the right man!"<br><br>Evelyn muttered that there was never a dull moment as she unleashed a magical bombardment no less powerful than the weapons of the Godly Blood Summoning Ritual. As the full power of the Leader of the White Blood Religion collided with that of Raon, Evelyn, and the Five Kings' leaders, the resulting massive shockwave tore a black hole in the sky and split the White Blood Religion Headquarters into dozens of pieces.<br><br>As the gray smoke that had spread across heaven and earth from the clash of aura and bloody energy subsided, the scene of the battlefield was revealed.<br><br>"Cough!"<br><br>Raon was on his knees, coughing up dead blood, while the Transcendents of the Five Kings lay as if dead, and Evelyn too was on her back, maintaining only the faintest breath.<br><br>"It's finally over."<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion smiled coldly as she reached out her hand.<br><br>"I'll personally take your life... Cough!"<br><br>As she was about to unleash bloody energy towards Raon, she coughed up white blood and bent over.<br><br>"Th-This is..."<br><br>Blood flowed from the Leader of the White Blood Religion's five apertures, and her arms and legs began to tremble as if intoxicated.<br><br>'The limit! She's reached her limit!'<br><br>Raon clenched his fist as he watched the Leader of the White Blood Religion falter. The limit had finally come for her too. And it seemed even more severe than Denier's.<br><br>"De-Denier!"<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion called out to Denier with difficulty, spitting blood repeatedly.<br><br>"Bring that! Now!"<br><br>She waved her hand roughly, ordering him to bring something.<br><br>"Understood..."<br><br>Denier wiped the blood and dirt from his mouth and turned around. He didn't go for himself but dashed towards Balder, who was watching cautiously from a distance.<br><br>"G-Get away!"<br><br>Balder threw Martha behind him and unleashed his flexible sword with all his might, but Denier slipped past the flexible sword with quick footwork and punched a hole in Balder's abdomen.<br><br>"Ugh..."<br><br>Balder fell backward, spewing blood from his abdomen. As Denier tried to grab Martha, who had fallen to the ground, the Light Wind Palace swordsmen who had finished the battle on the walls came to block his path.<br><br>"You can't..."<br><br>"Get him!"<br><br>Runaan and Burren, along with the Light Wind Palace swordsmen, deployed their sword formations as if determined never to hand over Martha.<br><br>"Huff!"<br><br>Denier charged towards the Light Wind Palace without even wiping the blood flowing from his nose.<br><br>"Strike!"<br><br>At Burren's intense cry, the swordsmen's hearts seemed to unite as powerful and swift sword strikes rained down.<br><br>"Urgh!"<br><br>Denier rushed towards Martha, taking the swords with his body. Strangely, he didn't attack the swordsmen, just dodging and running.<br><br>"You can't go!"<br><br>"No!"<br><br>"This is as far as you go!"<br><br>Burren, Runaan, and Mark Goetun stood in front of Denier, each unleashing their ultimate techniques.<br><br>"Get out of my way..."<br><br>Denier swung his sword for the first time. With his swift and sharp sword strike, the three Light Wind Palace executives were sent flying, spraying blood.<br><br>"..."<br><br>After knocking away all the interfering swordsmen, Denier stood before Martha.<br><br>"N-No..."<br><br>Runaan crawled on the ground, grabbing Denier's ankle as if determined not to let him go. Denier kicked Runaan away with his toe, then picked up Martha.<br><br>"You... I'll kill you too!"<br><br>Seeing Runaan reaching out her hand while bleeding, Martha shouted at Denier that she would kill him, as if she could no longer hold back.<br><br>"If you can..."<br><br>Denier accepted Martha's resentful gaze as he turned back towards the Leader of the White Blood Religion.<br><br>'I have to stop him...'<br><br>Raon bit his lip until it bled. The Leader of the White Blood Religion was clearly planning to switch her broken body for Martha's. He had to stop it somehow, but he couldn't move his body after overexerting himself using the sword technique.<br><br>"Well done..."<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion lowered her hand towards Denier, who had brought Martha.<br><br>"Now guard my front. The Godly Blood Summoning Ritual will block most attacks, but just in case."<br><br>She nodded, telling him to protect her with his life.<br><br>"It might take a while, so you should move somewhere else to do it..."<br><br>Denier glanced around, saying this place was dangerous.<br><br>"I gained insight into the soul just before this battle began. It's not fully awakened, but it shouldn't take long."<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion exhaled roughly, saying she could take over Martha's body without taking too long.<br><br>"Urgh!"<br><br>Raon forcibly stood up, his body feeling completely empty. He drew upon all the authorities of the demon kings, resonating the wavering ring of fire.<br><br>'I have to fight.'<br><br>Though the pain was so intense he wanted to die as his body and mind had reached their limit, he endured using Askara's Fighting Spirit and Iron Will.<br><br>"Give Martha back!"<br><br>As he rushed towards the Leader of the White Blood Religion to save Martha, the Godly Blood Summoning Ritual swung down swords and axes at him. In normal circumstances, he could easily avoid this, but with his body and mind at their limit, all he could do was block.<br><br>"Come on in! I'll devour your soul!"<br><br>Martha glared at the Leader of the White Blood Religion's black eyes, as if saying to try it.<br><br>"That won't happen."<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion cut her finger and shoved it into Martha's mouth.<br><br>"The moment you drink my blood, your soul will sink so deep it can never awaken."<br><br>She said it was all over now as she pushed her blood down Martha's throat.<br><br>"Aagh..."<br><br>Though Martha tried to resist by moving her tongue, as soon as the Leader of the White Blood Religion's blood entered her throat, her eyes turned a deathly gray.<br><br>"Martha!"<br><br>Raon deflected the weapons of the Godly Blood Summoning Ritual and aimed the Blade of Requiem at his own abdomen, holding it in reverse grip.<br><br>-Raon!<br><br>'Yes. There's no choice now.'<br><br>Just as he was about to plunge the Blade of Requiem into his stomach to use Demon King Manifestation, something happened.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Denier, who had been pointing his sword at Raon, turned around and approached the Leader of the White Blood Religion.<br><br>"Mother. That's enough."<br><br>Denier calmly muttered as he thrust his sword towards the Leader of the White Blood Religion's heart. The Leader of the White Blood Religion, her soul connected to Martha's, couldn't move a finger and was pierced through the chest by Denier's sword.<br><br>"Wh-Why are you..."<br><br>The Leader of the White Blood Religion raised her trembling eyes, coughing blood, as if she couldn't understand.<br><br>"We are..."<br><br>Denier gently stroked Martha's head, her eyes lifeless, as he formed a faint smile.<br><br>"Monsters that shouldn't exist in this world."</p>
