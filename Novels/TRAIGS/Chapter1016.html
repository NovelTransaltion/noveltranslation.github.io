        <p>"Would you please guide us to where the Thespian Emperor and the Queen of Swords are?"<br><br>Raon said that sightseeing could wait, looking at Mekein with eyes that emanated cold energy.<br><br>"Umm..."<br><br>Mekein swallowed hard, feeling not only Raon's but also the chilling aura of the Light Wind Palace swordsmen emerging from the dimensional gate.<br><br>"Umm, understood. We'll depart as soon as all the Light Wind Palace members have arrived."<br><br>He bowed his head, saying he would guide them to the Thespian Emperor as soon as the swordsmen came out.<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>Raon let out a small sigh of admiration as he watched Mekein reveal a calm gaze while hiding his flustered appearance.<br><br>'As I thought before, the Thespian Emperor certainly knows how to choose her people.'<br><br>Though not hostile, Mekein was no ordinary man, showing composure even in the face of such an overtly cold atmosphere.<br><br>"Everyone has arrived."<br><br>Burren approached Raon to report after personally confirming the number of Light Wind Palace swordsmen.<br><br>"Since they've all come out, let's depart now."<br><br>Raon nodded to Mekein, who was waiting by the door.<br><br>"Then I'll open the door."<br><br>Mekein took a deep breath, steeling himself against the frost-like aura of the Light Wind Palace swordsmen, and opened the magic tower's door. Brilliant sunlight poured in, revealing sophisticated houses and buildings. Though it wasn't yet late morning, people were bustling about, following their own schedules.<br><br>"This way, please."<br><br>Sensing the tense atmosphere, Mekein began walking towards the Thespian Emperor's castle without explaining about Barene.<br><br>"Let's go."<br><br>Raon gestured for the Light Wind division to follow and walked behind Mekein.<br><br>'Even at a glance, it's changed a lot.'<br><br>More than half of Barene had collapsed during the previous attack by the Five Demons. The streets were neatly paved, likely because most of the buildings had been rebuilt.<br><br>"As you may know, Light Wind Palace Master..."<br><br>Mekein slowly began speaking, seemingly having noticed Raon's gaze.<br><br>"Due to the attack by the Dark Night Sword God and other Five Demons, not only Barene's walls but the entire city was destroyed."<br><br>He let out a heavy sigh, saying it had been a desperate situation.<br><br>"After that attack, the residents were gripped by fear and tried to flee the city. However, seeing the Thespian Emperor release funds and personally lead the reconstruction efforts, not a single person left this land."<br><br>Mekein smiled gently, saying that afterward, the relationship between the Thespian Emperor and the residents grew even stronger.<br><br>"It certainly looks better than when I came before."<br><br>Raon nodded. As Mekein said, the city seemed to be filled with vitality and warmth, perhaps because they had overcome such a difficult time.<br><br>"You're right. Before, the city itself was sophisticated, but it didn't feel like people lived here. Now it's full of energy."<br><br>Martha smacked her lips, seeming to understand what he meant.<br><br>"Yes. The air feels warm..."<br><br>Runaan blinked her dull eyes, saying she felt good too.<br><br>"It feels like the inside has changed more than the outside. There seems to be a sense of closeness."<br><br>Burren smiled softly as he looked at the bustling market.<br><br>"I'm glad you see it that way."<br><br>Mekein's steps seemed to lighten as he climbed the hill, pleased by the praise for Barene's atmosphere.<br><br>"Actually, the castle where the Thespian Emperor stays was also rebuilt. It's over there."<br><br>He pointed to a mansion built in the center of the city, saying that a new building was erected because the castle had collapsed.<br><br>"It's smaller than I expected."<br><br>Martha tilted her head, looking at the Thespian Emperor's castle, which was only slightly larger than an annex building.<br><br>"Yeah. I think the building we saw before was even bigger than the Lord's Manor."<br><br>Burren scratched his chin, indicating he had similar thoughts.<br><br>"When rebuilding the city, priority was given to the residents' homes and livelihoods, so this was the best we could do with the limited manpower and funds."<br><br>Mekein smiled bitterly, saying that the Thespian Emperor's castle became smaller because she took care of the residents first.<br><br>"The Thespian Emperor didn't seem like that kind of person... oops!"<br><br>Krein quickly shut his mouth after receiving a glare from Mekein.<br><br>"It might seem that way."<br><br>Mekein laughed lightly, as if to say it was understandable.<br><br>"Krein..."<br><br>"Don't run your mouth carelessly. This isn't Zieghart."<br><br>Burren and Martha glared at Krein with icy eyes.<br><br>"I-I'm sorry."<br><br>Krein bowed his head deeply to Mekein, saying he was ashamed.<br><br>"It's alright. People's perspectives can vary."<br><br>Mekein waved his hand, telling him not to worry about it.<br><br>'Honestly...'<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he looked at the Thespian Emperor's living space, which seemed more like a mansion than a castle.<br><br>'Krein's words aren't wrong.'<br><br>The Thespian Emperor he had personally seen and felt was an intelligent opportunist. The fact that she built a smaller house, supposedly thinking of the residents first, made him think she was more concerned about people's eyes and rumors than actual consideration.<br><br>-Even if it was because of others' eyes and mouths, isn't it still a good thing in the end?<br><br>Wrath rolled his blue eyes as if finding it strange.<br><br>'You're right. It is a good thing.'<br><br>As Wrath said, it was good for the residents regardless of how it came about, so Raon nodded with a small smile.<br><br>"Then I'll be back shortly."<br><br>Mekein asked them to wait a moment before entering the Thespian Emperor's mansion.<br><br>'Is the Thespian Emperor on the second floor?'<br><br>An enormous soul presence that could envelop the entire city and more emanated from inside the mansion. Perhaps because he had grown stronger, the Thespian Emperor's martial prowess felt powerful enough to shake his core.<br><br>'To be this strong even without revealing her aura.'<br><br>She certainly deserves to be a representative of the Five Divine Orders. Raon turned to the Light Wind Palace swordsmen with a thin smile.<br><br>"Not everyone can enter the conference room, so the Warring Steel Leader will stay behind to manage the swordsmen."<br><br>He entrusted the swordsmen to Trevin, who had the most experience leading subordinates.<br><br>"Understood."<br><br>Trevin smiled brightly and struck his chest with his fist, as if saying to trust him.<br><br>"Light Wind division, remember what I said and maintain the demeanor befitting a Zieghart swordsman."<br><br>As soon as he finished speaking about maintaining their demeanor, the swordsmen's aura, which had relaxed in Barene's warm atmosphere, became even colder than before.<br><br>"Understood!"<br><br>The Light Wind Palace swordsmen nodded and struck their chests with their fists like Trevin, as if saying they wouldn't disappoint.<br><br>"We must escort the Palace Master, so be even more mindful of your behavior."<br><br>Burren frowned at Martha and Runaan, pleading with them to be careful.<br><br>"You be careful."<br><br>Martha jerked her chin at Runaan.<br><br>"Not me, Miss Rakshasa...?"<br><br>Runaan shook her head, saying the arrow was misdirected.<br><br>"I mean you!"<br><br>"You are Miss Rakshasa, not me..."<br><br>The two gritted their teeth while poking each other's cheeks with their fingers.<br><br>"Both of you!"<br><br>Burren shouted at them to stop, separating Martha and Runaan.<br><br>"Hmph!"<br><br>Martha snorted and closed her eyes. However, she didn't continue to be angry and instead began cultivating her aura right there.<br><br>'She really seems determined to personally beat the Leader of the White Blood Religion.'<br><br>As Raon was smiling gently at Martha, who was trying to train even in her spare time, Mekein came out of the mansion with a wrinkle on his forehead.<br><br>"Is something wrong?"<br><br>Raon lowered his eyebrows as he looked at Mekein, who had come out alone.<br><br>"The original appointment was at noon, so the Queen of Swords hasn't arrived yet. The Thespian Emperor is in the middle of work, but she said she would meet you right away if the Palace Master wishes."<br><br>Mekein bowed his head as if asking what they wanted to do.<br><br>"For now, it might be better to see the Thespian Emperor first..."<br><br>"No. I think it would be better to see both of them together."<br><br>Raon shook his head, saying he would meet them together in the conference room.<br><br>'Whether this is a ploy or not, there's no need to give them time to think by meeting separately.'<br><br>The Thespian Emperor would be able to read the atmosphere just by seeing him. It seemed better to see both of them at once to be able to reach a conclusion immediately.<br><br>"I apologize."<br><br>"There's no reason for you to apologize, Mekein. If anything, we're the ones who came early."<br><br>"Th-then I'll guide you to the reception room for now."<br><br>Mekein entered a small building to the right of the mansion. Perhaps because it was where guests waited, it looked more splendid than the mansion.<br><br>"I'll bring some tea."<br><br>He said he would be back soon and ran outside.<br><br>'We have a lot of time left until noon.'<br><br>The preparation and movement through the dimensional gate had gone much more smoothly than expected, leaving them with extra time.<br><br>'Should I read a book in the meantime?'<br><br>He took out an old book from his subspace pouch. It was a book that Glenn had personally brought to the annex building. He hadn't had time to read it due to aura cultivation and wound recovery, but it seemed like a good idea to look at it now.<br><br>'I wonder what kind of martial arts manual it is... Hm?'<br><br>This isn't a martial arts manual?<br><br>[Nurturing the soul is like raising a young tree. If nurtured with a healthy mind, deep and thick roots will spread out, unshakeable, but if raised with a sick mind, the roots will spread shallow and narrow, breaking even in small rain and wind.]<br><br>Looking through the contents of the book, it wasn't a martial arts manual, but rather described methods for controlling the mind and spirit.<br><br>[The soul is like water in a vessel. Usually calm and undisturbed, but when impacted from the outside, it surges as if to escape the vessel. One must always be able to handle one's soul calmly to reach higher realms.]<br><br>Raon read the contents that seemed like a pseudo-bible and opened the last page.<br><br>[A year is soon ten years, ten years gather to make a hundred years, and a hundred years flow to become a thousand years. However, ten thousand years cannot be reached in this way. It is a time and realm that cannot be handled by human minds. It can only be manifested through mental images and the soul.]<br><br>He narrowed his eyes as he looked at the last page.<br><br>'This is...'<br><br>Something's different. Unlike the phrases he had read so far, it seemed like there was more than just content related to the soul.<br><br>'How should I put it...'<br><br>It feels like I should understand, but I can't.<br><br>'Let's keep reading.'<br><br>Raon became deeply immersed in the last page of the book, forgetting even that Mekein had placed tea on the table.<br><br>***<br><br>Knock knock. As Raon was engraving the contents of the last page in his mind after reading it countless times, the door opened with a knock.<br><br>"The Queen of Swords has arrived. Would you like to go now?"<br><br>Mekein bowed his head, saying the conference preparations were complete.<br><br>"Yes. Let's go."<br><br>Raon stood up, putting the book back into his subspace pouch.<br><br>"The conference room is behind the mansion. This way, please."<br><br>Following Mekein, who carefully began guiding them, they walked to the back of the mansion. Whoosh. Burren, Martha, Runaan, and Mark Goetun moved like shadows, silently following behind him.<br><br>"That's the conference room of the Five Divine Orders."<br><br>Mekein nodded slightly, pointing to a conference room that exuded the dignity of an ancient cathedral.<br><br>"This conference room was built as large and grand as possible, considering the reputation of the other Five Divine Orders members."<br><br>Mekein nodded, saying this was the one thing they couldn't compromise on.<br><br>"I agree that's the right approach."<br><br>Raon nodded and surveyed the conference room.<br><br>'It looks both splendid and solid.'<br><br>It wasn't just about the appearance. The conference room seemed to exude a firmness as if vowing never to collapse again.<br><br>"Whew."<br><br>Mekein composed himself and then personally opened the door to the conference room. With a rumbling sound, the massive door opened, revealing the interior.<br><br>In the center of the conference room stood a snow-white round table, and at its ends sat two breathtakingly beautiful women in different postures.<br><br>The Thespian Emperor in the center emanated a mysterious atmosphere as if she could wash away all the impurities of this world, while the Queen of Swords on the right exuded a sharp presence as if a sword had taken human form.<br><br>"You've arrived."<br><br>The Thespian Emperor rose from her chair with graceful poise and gave a slight bow.<br><br>"It's been a while."<br><br>The Queen of Swords merely nodded without changing her posture.<br><br>"I'm glad to see you both looking well."<br><br>Raon stood before the round table, easily deflecting the transcendent aura naturally emitted by the Thespian Emperor and the Queen of Swords.<br><br>"Hmm."<br><br>"..."<br><br>A distinct gleam appeared in the eyes of both women as they observed him.<br><br>"Seeing it in person is even more surprising."<br><br>The Thespian Emperor let out a small gasp as she looked into Raon's red eyes.<br><br>"I had heard various rumors, but to think you really reached that level."<br><br>She shook her head, saying it was an achievement hard to believe even after seeing it.<br><br>"It's enough to make me doubt my own eyes."<br><br>The Queen of Swords lowered her delicate eyebrows.<br><br>"Now I understand why those ugly creatures died."<br><br>She tapped her fingers on the round table, saying she now knew why he could defeat the Demonblade and the Demon Slaying Spear.<br><br>"Come to think of it, I haven't properly congratulated you. Congratulations on reaching transcendence."<br><br>The Thespian Emperor bowed deeply, saying her congratulations were late.<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>Raon bowed back, meeting the Thespian Emperor's serene gaze.<br><br>'She's strong.'<br><br>Seeing her in person, the realm of the soul possessed by the Thespian Emperor felt even more immense. A martial artist clearly different from the Demonblade and the Demon Slaying Spear. While his chances of winning were high, it didn't seem easy to guarantee victory unconditionally.<br><br>'And the Queen of Swords...'<br><br>He turned his gaze to the right to look at the Queen of Swords.<br><br>'She's weaker than the Thespian Emperor.'<br><br>As he had seen and felt before, the Queen of Swords' martial prowess was clearly inferior to the Thespian Emperor's. Higher than the Demonblade, but similar to the Demon Slaying Spear's level. If they fought, he could win ten out of ten times.<br><br>'But why did the Head of House speak as if we should be more cautious of the Queen of Swords?'<br><br>Glenn had calmly accepted the statement about being able to defeat the Thespian Emperor, but seemed to have doubts regarding the Queen of Swords.<br><br>'He's not the type to joke around.'<br><br>Unlike Rimmer, Glenn had no reason to joke about such an important matter. It seemed clear that the Queen of Swords possessed something he didn't know about.<br><br>'I should be careful.'<br><br>To avoid being surprised no matter what happens. Thud. Raon placed his interlocked hands on the round table, calming his tense inner self.<br><br>"There's a rumor I've heard recently..."<br><br>The Queen of Swords narrowed her eyes as she looked at him.<br><br>"Is it true that you killed The Fallen?"<br><br>She let out a low groan, as if she couldn't believe it.<br><br>"Most exaggerated stories are just rumors."<br><br>Raon chuckled and waved his hand.<br><br>"I thought so."<br><br>The Queen of Swords clicked her tongue briefly.<br><br>"It's true that you're strong, but not enough to defeat The Fallen."<br><br>She nodded, seeming to consider The Fallen's death as a false rumor.<br><br>"..."<br><br>The Thespian Emperor remained silent, just looking at him with transparent eyes.<br><br>"However, that rumor is true."<br><br>Raon slowly raised his hand.<br><br>"The Fallen is dead. Of course, it wasn't something I did alone."<br><br>He only revealed the fact that The Fallen was dead, without explaining everything.<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>The Queen of Swords' eyes rippled violently like a stormy sea.<br><br>"H-how?"<br><br>She stood up, striking the round table as if she couldn't understand.<br><br>"During the Black Tower Master incident, there was an Archmage of Eternal Flame, but not this time!"<br><br>The Queen of Swords looked at him with trembling eyes, as if asking him to explain the circumstances.<br><br>"..."<br><br>The Thespian Emperor calmly drank her tea, not showing any sign of surprise. She seemed to know all the facts already.<br><br>"It's not difficult to explain the situation, but before that, there's something I need to ask both of you first."<br><br>Raon calmly shook his head.<br><br>"What is it?"<br><br>The Queen of Swords narrowed her eyes.<br><br>"Please go ahead."<br><br>The Thespian Emperor quietly put down her teacup, as if ready to answer anything.<br><br>"I, or rather, Zieghart, believe we have given the Five Divine Orders many opportunities. So now I want to hear a definitive answer."<br><br>Raon spoke with a piercing gaze.<br><br>"Whether you'll walk the same path as the Five Kings or die here..."<br><br>He tilted his chin arrogantly, looking down at the two women with wide eyes.<br><br>"Make your choice now."</p>
