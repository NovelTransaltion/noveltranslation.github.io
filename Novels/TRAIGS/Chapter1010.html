        <p>-Come out right now! Fight me!<br><br>Wrath shouted at the system, punching the air.<br><br>'Let's see what we have here.'<br><br>Raon ignored Wrath's tantrum and checked the messages that appeared before him.<br><br>[You have defeated an extremely high-ranking opponent.]<br><br>[You have gained the recognition of .]<br><br>[You have witnessed a battle between absolute beings.]<br><br>[You have achieved a great feat!]<br><br>Even without rewards, there were already four lines of confirmation messages. It seemed he had accomplished quite a lot this time.<br><br>'The extremely high-ranking opponent must be The Fallen.'<br><br>The Demon Slaying Spear was around his level, so that extremely high-ranking opponent had to be The Fallen.<br><br>'Does this message mean The Fallen really died?'<br><br>The Fallen had lived for hundreds of years and had the ability to revive immediately after death, so Raon couldn't be sure even after cutting him with the Soul Sword. But seeing this reward message, it seemed he really had died this time.<br><br>'Still, I shouldn't let my guard down just in case.'<br><br>Raon recalled The Fallen's twisted smile as he looked at the content below.<br><br>'The battle between absolute beings was definitely helpful.'<br><br>Glenn and the Heavenly Demon fought in a realm of ultimate mastery that Raon couldn't reach, but thanks to the Ring of Fire, he could feel a bit of the flow of martial arts they wielded. Glenn honed a sword of the mind that could cut through anything, while the Heavenly Demon forged fists of offense and defense that would never break by tempering his soul.<br><br>Having seen the true intentions of these two Transcendents, Raon could grasp a clue about which path he should take.<br><br>-Which way will you go?<br><br>Wrath stopped punching and looked down at him curiously.<br><br>'Before that, which side are you on?'<br><br>Raon nodded slightly towards Wrath. He was curious about which path this guy had taken, since he was in the same position as Glenn and the Heavenly Demon.<br><br>-Such things cannot be explained with words.<br><br>Wrath shook his head calmly, uncharacteristically.<br><br>-You'll have to see and feel it for yourself, like this time.<br><br>He snorted as if telling Raon to check for himself later.<br><br>'That's true. In that case...'<br><br>Raon smiled faintly at the serious Wrath.<br><br>'I'll have to postpone deciding which path to take for a while.'<br><br>-Why?<br><br>Wrath frowned as if asking what he meant.<br><br>'Because I think you're stronger than anyone else. I want to decide what sword I need to achieve after seeing your path.'<br><br>In truth, from the moment he picked up a sword, Raon had vowed to become an unbreakable swordsman to achieve his goal. That resolve was still valid, but as he met many connections and experienced various events, other paths were blooming alongside the unbreakable sword.<br><br>-R-really? You do know something after all!<br><br>Wrath suddenly seemed pleased, wagging his tail.<br><br>-Actually, if I put my mind to it, I could easily devour that old Nadine bread or that lizard helmet!<br><br>He chuckled, saying he could defeat Glenn and the Heavenly Demon without much difficulty.<br><br>'Is that so.'<br><br>Raon smirked at Wrath, who was blushing with excitement. He used to try not to lie as much as possible, but now it seemed he was just saying whatever came to mind.<br><br>'Now then...'<br><br>-What are you going to do?<br><br>'I'll continue looking at the messages I was checking.'<br><br>As Wrath came closer, Raon pulled up the messages below.<br><br>[All abilities increase by 100 points.]<br><br>[A new trait has been created.]<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>Raon's eyes widened as soon as he saw the content of the messages.<br><br>"100 points?"<br><br>He knew he would receive many points, but he didn't expect to get 100 points at once. He exclaimed out loud without realizing it.<br><br>-A-again, 100 points?<br><br>Wrath's lips trembled in disbelief.<br><br>-Isn't that too much! How does this make sense!<br><br>He gritted his teeth, shouting that it was too much no matter how he looked at it.<br><br>'I deserve it, though.'<br><br>-Why! Tell me the reason!<br><br>Wrath frowned, saying there was no reason to receive 100 points.<br><br>'Why? You acknowledged it yourself.'<br><br>Raon pointed to the message above about 's recognition.<br><br>-Urgh...<br><br>Seeing the message that he had acknowledged it, Wrath could only breathe rapidly, unable to refute.<br><br>'Right?'<br><br>Raon patted Wrath's head as he shuddered, then checked the new trait.<br><br>'Soul Sword (Spirit), huh...'<br><br>It seemed to have become Soul Sword (Spirit) instead of just Soul Sword because he created a sword of the soul using the power of the Blade of Requiem.<br><br>'Where's the Blade of Requiem?'<br><br>Raon raised his body again and looked around. Fortunately, the Blade of Requiem was standing next to the bed along with the Heavenly Drive and the Wooden Ring Sword. It seemed someone had brought them after they were stuck in the ground.<br><br>-At least they're not making traits purely based on cheating.<br><br>Wrath snorted as he looked at Soul Sword (Spirit).<br><br>-Well, they couldn't give the name Soul Sword to a sword that can't even cut a single person.<br><br>'That's true.'<br><br>As Wrath said, Raon's Soul Sword was so small and weak that it couldn't even cut the soul of an ordinary person, so even the name Soul Sword (Spirit) was too much for now.<br><br>'However...'<br><br>The path has been opened. The most important factor in learning martial arts is whether one can step into that realm or not. Raon was fortunate enough to have one foot in the realm of the Soul Sword, so someday he would be able to climb that path alone.<br><br>'I'm looking forward to it.'<br><br>Raon smiled and called up the next message.<br><br>[The rank of trait increases.]<br><br>[The rank of trait increases.]<br><br>[The rank of trait increases.]<br><br>[The rank of trait increases.]<br><br>[The rank of trait increases.]<br><br>[The rank of trait increases.]<br><br>[The rank of trait increases.]<br><br>[The rank of trait increases.]<br><br>[The rank of trait increases.]<br><br>[The rank of trait increases.]<br><br>"Huh..."<br><br>Raon let out a breath as he saw the flood of trait increase messages.<br><br>'That's more than I expected?'<br><br>Ten traits had increased in rank. It had been a while since so many traits had risen at once, to the point where he felt overwhelmed.<br><br>-Haah...<br><br>Wrath let out a long sigh as if he was about to vomit.<br><br>-System! Has this damn thing gone mad! Why is it giving so much at once!<br><br>He screamed, asking what they were thinking.<br><br>-Are you really trying to leave only bones in my main body!<br><br>'It can't be helped. They're all things I used in this battle.'<br><br>While it was true that many traits had increased in rank, if you looked closely, there was a reason for each one.<br><br>-No matter what, ten is too many!<br><br>Wrath shook his head firmly, saying he couldn't accept it.<br><br>'I'm telling you, I deserve it.'<br><br>-No, you don't! Why do you deserve... hup!<br><br>He was about to ask for a reason but clamped his mouth shut.<br><br>'Why...'<br><br>But Raon didn't miss the opportunity and flashed a bright smile.<br><br>'You acknowledged it yourself.'<br><br>He grinned and pointed again to the message saying had acknowledged him.<br><br>-Arghhhh!<br><br>Wrath grabbed his own head and screamed.<br><br>-This mouth is the problem! I'll never speak again!<br><br>He pressed his lips tightly, saying he wouldn't acknowledge anyone anymore.<br><br>'That won't be easy, you know?'<br><br>The Wrath he had seen so far was honest in a way unbefitting a demon king. If he experienced something similar again, he would surely acknowledge it the same way.<br><br>'Now for the last one.'<br><br>Raon checked the message floating at the very bottom.<br><br>[The title evolves into .]<br><br>The last message was about a title. However, it wasn't a new one, but a change in the name of an existing title.<br><br>'Come to think of it, that title...'<br><br>He remembered that unlike other titles, it had no content at all.<br><br>'Let's see...'<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes and checked the content of the newly created title. He narrowed his eyes as he read the title's content. [ A title given to one who has changed the shackles of fate determined by heaven through their own will.]<br><br>'The Heavenly Demon said something similar.'<br><br>The Heavenly Demon had sneered, holding a mask fragment, saying that The Fallen had read heaven's flow and come, only to be defeated by him.<br><br>'Does this mean I can decide my own fate?'<br><br>Heaven's flow is already a fate determined by heaven. It's known that no one can change it, but it seemed that this transcendent power didn't apply to him. However, he wasn't sure if it was because of the Ring of Fire or because of this cotton candy stuck next to him.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>Raon briefly licked his lips while looking at Wrath.<br><br>'There's something I want to ask you...'<br><br>Just as he was about to ask Wrath a question, the door opened violently as if it was about to break.<br><br>"Oh? Raon!"<br><br>It was Evelyn. She ran towards him, her maid uniform of the annex building fluttering.<br><br>"When did you wake up? Are you alright?"<br><br>Evelyn looked over his injuries, rolling her purple eyes this way and that.<br><br>"I'm fine. But why are you wearing that outfit again..."<br><br>Just as he was about to ask why she was wearing the maid uniform, Sylvia and Sia burst out from the open door.<br><br>"Raon!"<br><br>"You're awake!"<br><br>The two of them also ran towards him as soon as they saw he was awake, as if they were about to break the floor.<br><br>"You've finally woken up. Everyone was worried because you wouldn't wake up even after treatment."<br><br>Sylvia let out a sigh of relief, saying it was fortunate.<br><br>"You slept too much!"<br><br>Sia also pouted her lips as if she had been worried.<br><br>"I'm sorry. I think I was mentally exhausted as well as physically injured."<br><br>Raon smiled and held Sylvia and Sia's hands.<br><br>"So how do you feel?"<br><br>Evelyn sat on the edge of the bed and gave a faint smile. With her true face revealed, she showed a radiant beauty that outshone even the sunlight flowing through the window. She looked like noble royalty even in a maid uniform.<br><br>"There's still some pain, but it's bearable."<br><br>Raon nodded slowly while rotating his shoulders.<br><br>"Actually, this much is getting off lightly."<br><br>Killing The Fallen and the Demon Slaying Spear, and returning alive from the Heavenly Demon - this level of injury wasn't just light, it was practically nothing.<br><br>"Haah..."<br><br>Sylvia exhaled a turbid breath while holding his hand tightly.<br><br>"I don't understand why only you encounter such dangerous situations."<br><br>She bit her lip, saying she was too worried.<br><br>"Hmm, it seems you've all heard."<br><br>Raon lowered his gaze while gently wrapping Sylvia's trembling hand.<br><br>"I told them."<br><br>Evelyn nodded heavily as if she had explained the circumstances.<br><br>"I think it's natural for a swordsman to face danger when they take up a sword and stand on the battlefield. But you don't need to worry too much. I have good companions by my side."<br><br>Raon smiled while looking into Evelyn's eyes.<br><br>"As you may have heard, Mother, it was thanks to Evelyn that we caught The Fallen. I just swung my sword at the end."<br><br>He waved his hand, saying not to worry because others were fighting alongside him.<br><br>"What? Is that true?"<br><br>Sylvia widened her eyes as if she hadn't known at all.<br><br>"Huh? Didn't she tell you?"<br><br>Raon exhaled in surprise, looking back and forth between Sylvia and Evelyn.<br><br>"She told us you defeated The Fallen, but this is the first I'm hearing about fighting together."<br><br>Sylvia gaped blankly, saying she had no idea.<br><br>"What did you say then?"<br><br>Raon blinked at Evelyn.<br><br>"It's embarrassing..."<br><br>Evelyn covered her reddened cheeks with her hands as if she was shy.<br><br>"Uh...?"<br><br>Raon swallowed dryly, realizing something was wrong.<br><br>"I told them how we called each other's names and spent the night together. Oh, and that we saw my mother together."<br><br>Evelyn turned her gaze slightly, saying she only told the truth.<br><br>"Huh..."<br><br>Raon's jaw trembled, too shocked to speak.<br><br>"I-is that really true? I can't believe it..."<br><br>Sylvia took rough breaths, as if wondering how there was time for such things during an intense battle.<br><br>"No! Of course not!"<br><br>Raon shook his head so vigorously that flames almost erupted.<br><br>"That's all lies..."<br><br>"What do you mean lies? It's all true."<br><br>Evelyn nudged him with her shoulder as if telling him to admit it.<br><br>"I-it's true, but that's not what it means! The words are completely different!"<br><br>Calling Evelyn's name and spending the night together was true, but it all happened in the mental world. She was deliberately saying things that could only be misunderstood.<br><br>"Raon."<br><br>Edgar, who had been watching by the door, lowered his eyebrows deeply.<br><br>"A man should admit what needs to be admitted."<br><br>He shook his head as if saying Raon shouldn't pretend not to know.<br><br>"I'm telling you it's not true!"<br><br>Raon jumped up and shouted. He was so flustered that he forgot the pain in his body.<br><br>'I'm tired. Suddenly I'm so tired.'<br><br>Evelyn's aggressiveness and actions made him feel so fatigued that he wanted to go back to sleep. He just wanted to rest, not caring about anything else.<br><br>'But...'<br><br>Raon smiled faintly as he watched Evelyn laughing while treating Sylvia and Edgar like her mother and father.<br><br>'It's nice to see.'<br><br>It was a bit relieving to see the young child who had longed for a mother's embrace find happiness and stability again. As Raon was smiling while watching Evelyn rushing towards him and Sylvia backing away, suddenly Zieghart - no, the entire estate shook.<br><br>"W-what's going on..."<br><br>Raon frowned as he watched dust falling from the ceiling.<br><br>"Is it an enemy attack?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>As he was about to grab the swords leaning by the bed, Edgar shook his head.<br><br>"Since you collapsed, these earthquakes have been happening three times a day."<br><br>Sylvia sighed in exasperation and turned her gaze towards the main building.<br><br>"I think these earthquakes will continue until you show your face to him."<br><br>She nodded as if telling him to go see Glenn now that he was up.<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>Raon exhaled as he looked at the garden that seemed to be shaking even more violently than the annex building.<br><br>"T-then please tell him I'll go pay my respects in the afternoon. I can't go in this state."<br><br>Raon said he would go see Glenn after washing up as he got up.<br><br>"Good thinking! Father will like that too!"<br><br>Sylvia nodded as if telling him to just go and say hello that he was safe, and sent a maid to the main building.<br><br>'Let's get ready.'<br><br>It was true that his body still hurt, but it wouldn't necessarily get better just by staying still. It seemed good to go greet Glenn and ask about what had happened in the meantime.<br><br>"I'll go take a shower and be back."<br><br>As Raon was about to go to the bathroom with a towel, Evelyn clung to his side.<br><br>"Shall I wash you? It should be fine since we spent the night together."<br><br>She smiled softly, saying she would wash him herself.<br><br>"Don't you dare come near me."<br><br>Raon shook his head and quickly backed away from Evelyn.<br><br>"How cute."<br><br>Evelyn licked her lips as she watched Raon fleeing quickly.<br><br>"..."<br><br>Sylvia and Edgar shuddered as if frightened by Evelyn's behavior.<br><br>"Mom."<br><br>Sia pointed at Evelyn, taking her finger out of her mouth.<br><br>"Is that what you call a pervert?"<br><br>"Shh."<br><br>"Keep such thoughts to yourself!"<br><br>***<br><br>"..."<br><br>Raon glanced slightly to his right. Standing straight in front of the right pillar of the audience chamber were Alice, Karoon, Denier, Balder, and other members of the Direct Lineage, watching him intently.<br><br>"Hmm..."<br><br>He let out a short groan and looked to his left. Sheryl, the Heavenly Blade Division Leader, Chad, the Shadow Agents' Leader, Serena, the Void Sword Division Leader, and Latein, the Leader of the Vanguard Sword Squad, were smiling with sparkling eyes. Behind them, the vice-captains of the Martial Prowess Division, including the Light Wind Palace, stood watching his back like spectators.<br><br>"Haah..."<br><br>Raon let out a long sigh as he looked at the floor.<br><br>'Why?'<br><br>Why did it turn out like this? He had just come to say hello that he was safe, but when he arrived at the Lord's Manor, all the executives of Zieghart were gathered waiting for him. He was so dumbfounded that cold sweat ran down his back.<br><br>"Ugh..."<br><br>Raon pressed his lips tightly and slowly raised his head. Glenn was standing on a deeply sunken platform, chuckling merrily.<br><br>"Well then. Tell us in your own words what happened there."<br><br>Glenn nodded his big head as if he had been waiting for this moment his entire life.<br><br>-That old Nadine bread.<br><br>Wrath shook his head as if he had expected this.<br><br>-Here we go with the doting again...</p>
