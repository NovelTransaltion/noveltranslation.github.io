        <p>"Father. A guest has arrived!"<br><br>Terian knocked on the old door before entering the lord's office where cold wind was seeping in.<br><br>"A guest?"<br><br>Lord Milland of Habun Castle looked up from his yellowed desk. Though short in stature, the determination and spirit in his eyes burned even hotter than before.<br><br>"It's been a while."<br><br>Raon stood before the old desk and bowed to Milland.<br><br>"Lord of Habun Castle."<br><br>"R-Raon?"<br><br>Milland kicked back his chair and came around the desk.<br><br>"How did you come here!"<br><br>His smile was so bright it seemed to light up the room, as if he hadn't expected Raon to come to Habun Castle at all.<br><br>"I followed Yua here. I missed Habun Castle a bit, with its mix of cold and warmth."<br><br>Raon nodded as he said he wanted to visit Habun Castle after so long.<br><br>"True. There's no place quite like Habun Castle. Welcome back!"<br><br>Milland slapped Raon's back with his massive hands, seeming delighted just to see him again.<br><br>"You haven't changed at all, my lord."<br><br>Raon smiled while rubbing his back where Milland had hit him.<br><br>"No, you seem to have gotten younger."<br><br>"I do look in mirrors, you know."<br><br>Milland waved his hand dismissively.<br><br>"Don't say such nonsense."<br><br>"No. I'm being sincere."<br><br>In truth, Milland's face had new wrinkles, and his once-smooth silver hair had turned completely white, making him look every bit an old man. Yet strangely, the vigor and determination emanating from him were much stronger than before.<br><br>'He's close to becoming a Grandmaster.'<br><br>Milland was on the verge of breaking through to Grandmaster. With just one catalyst, he would surely reach the next level.<br><br>"Since becoming Palace Master, you've learned to flatter. You used to be so quiet and unresponsive, I thought you were a statue."<br><br>Milland let out a hearty laugh, saying he was glad Raon had brightened up.<br><br>"He certainly was an odd one."<br><br>Terian let out a short sigh, seemingly recalling how Raon used to be.<br><br>"I've heard all about your achievements. The Black Tower Master, The Fallen, and now even the Leader of the White Blood Religion. You're accomplishing things that even the continent's strongest couldn't achieve."<br><br>Milland nodded with a proud smile on his face.<br><br>"I was lucky in many ways."<br><br>Raon waved his hand, saying it wasn't due to his ability.<br><br>"When it happens three times, luck becomes skill."<br><br>Milland snorted, as if to say this was beyond the point of being modest.<br><br>"Lord! I'm here too!"<br><br>Dorian quickly waved his hand, seeming sad about not getting any attention.<br><br>"Of course I see you."<br><br>Milland smiled as he touched Dorian's chubby cheeks.<br><br>"You've become a Master too. Congratulations."<br><br>He gripped Dorian's shoulder, remarking how the porter who used to distribute fruit at Habun Castle had become a real swordsman.<br><br>"Of course! I've grown a lot too!"<br><br>Dorian grinned happily at the praise from the usually stern Milland.<br><br>"I'm here too!"<br><br>Evelyn pressed her shoulder against Milland with a bright smile.<br><br>"W-Who...?"<br><br>Milland stepped back slightly, indicating he had no recollection.<br><br>"I couldn't possibly not remember someone like you?"<br><br>"You know, that time when a doppelganger tired to kidnap Yua.."<br><br>[Don't!]<br><br>Raon covered Evelyn's mouth while sending an aura message.<br><br>[Why would you bring up something like that!]<br><br>He couldn't understand why she would try to bring up the failed attempt to kidnap Yua using a doppelganger here.<br><br>[I just want to establish some common ground!]<br><br>Evelyn shook her head, saying she wanted to share past stories together.<br><br>[Still, that's something you don't need to mention!]<br><br>He removed his hand from Evelyn's mouth while begging her to stop. He couldn't understand what kind of mindset would lead to such behavior.<br><br>-I'm telling you, she's not right in the head. Just a moth drawn to the flame!<br><br>Wrath furrowed his brow, saying Evelyn was like a moth that jumps into the fire without thinking of the consequences.<br><br>"A doppelganger trying to kidnap Yua? You were there?"<br><br>Milland tilted his head, still not seeming to remember despite the explanation.<br><br>"No! It's nothing, just nonsense."<br><br>Raon shook his head with an awkward smile.<br><br>"Is that so..."<br><br>Milland scratched his temple as if trying his best to remember Evelyn's face.<br><br>"I heard on my way here that monsters are attacking again?"<br><br>Raon brought up the monster attacks to change the subject.<br><br>"That's exactly right. Monster attacks have increased recently."<br><br>Milland nodded with furrowed brows.<br><br>"Not only has the number of monsters increased, but the frequency of attacks has also risen. It's like we've returned to the time when you were here."<br><br>He licked his lips, saying they were fighting battles every day because of it.<br><br>"What about the types of monsters?"<br><br>"The species haven't changed. Ice trolls, white orcs, ogres, and all other winter monsters are gathering here."<br><br>Milland tapped his finger on the map showing Habun Castle, saying the types of monsters hadn't particularly changed.<br><br>"I see."<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he looked at Habun Castle and the Sterlin Mountains further north.<br><br>'This isn't Eden's doing.'<br><br>If Eden had interfered, there would have been new types of monsters or they would have enhanced their martial prowess with elite monsters. Since the types and strength remained the same, it was likely a natural occurrence.<br><br>"We fought just this morning. That's why you can smell the burning corpses."<br><br>Milland clasped his hands together, apologizing for making them smell the stench as soon as they arrived.<br><br>"It-it must be tough..."<br><br>Dorian's lips trembled as if remembering the hellish life at Habun Castle.<br><br>"I actually prefer it this way."<br><br>Milland gripped the sword leaning beside his desk, his lips curling upward.<br><br>"Each fight makes me feel alive. It had been boring since you left!"<br><br>Despite his words about boredom, he showed Raon a smile tinged with gratitude.<br><br>"Father, really..."<br><br>Terian shook his head, unable to understand Milland.<br><br>"But are you alright?"<br><br>Milland narrowed his eyes as he looked at Raon.<br><br>"I heard the Destructive King of the North has started the successor selection trial, is it okay for you to be here?"<br><br>He tilted his chin questioningly, as if wondering why Raon had come to Habun Castle during such an important test.<br><br>"That's..."<br><br>Just as Raon was about to answer.<br><br>"Lord! Vice-Lord! We're under attack!"<br><br>A ranger burst through the door, his breath visible in the cold air as he shouted that monsters were invading.<br><br>"Already?"<br><br>"B-but it hasn't even been half a day..."<br><br>Milland and Terian frowned, as if they hadn't expected this at all.<br><br>"The scale is larger than this morning! Since repairs aren't finished, the walls or gates might collapse!"<br><br>The ranger bowed, saying they needed to hurry and stop them.<br><br>"Let's continue our talk later!"<br><br>Milland drew his sword and rushed out of the office.<br><br>"I'll go too!"<br><br>Terian put on his helmet and ran outside.<br><br>-It would be easier if they just asked you for help, wouldn't it?<br><br>Wrath squinted his eyes in incomprehension.<br><br>-Such fools, honestly.<br><br>'They're not fools, they're wise.'<br><br>Raon shook his head as he looked around the office where cold wind was flowing.<br><br>'No matter how close we are, they believe in handling their own responsibilities.'<br><br>As he reflected on Milland's steadfast character and spirit, he climbed the snow-covered stairs to the castle walls. Whoosh! The snowstorm painted everything white like a blank canvas, and above it spread a green wave of monsters like spilled paint.<br><br>Facing the war of arrows raining through the snow and monsters clinging to the walls despite their wounds, he felt as if he had returned to the past.<br><br>"Fire!"<br><br>Milland mercilessly unleashed his astral energy, tearing apart the monsters trying to break down the gate.<br><br>"Don't let them touch the walls!"<br><br>Terian too summoned his astral energy, proof of his Master status, as he beheaded the monsters flying toward the walls.<br><br>"Lord. You asked if it was okay for me to be here when Zieghart is in chaos over successor selection?"<br><br>Raon stood at the edge of the wall as he drew the Heavenly Drive. A resonating hum filled the air as countless petals bloomed above the World Tree of flames emerging from his sword. The burning petals drifted down like autumn leaves, creating a storm of flames.<br><br>The massive vortex of flames swallowed whole the monster army attempting to destroy the walls.<br><br>Kuwaaaaaah! The flames rose as if to touch the sky, melting the monsters without leaving even a bone fragment, before dissipating into warm wind.<br><br>"Huh!"<br><br>"W-what is this?"<br><br>"Impossible..."<br><br>"That's supposed to be human swordsmanship?"<br><br>"Sword Emperor Raon Zieghart..."<br><br>The knights and rangers standing on the wall couldn't close their gaping mouths, as if they were dreaming.<br><br>"Raon. You..."<br><br>Even Milland's eyes trembled in surprise.<br><br>"This is my answer."<br><br>Raon smiled as he shook off his still-hot Heavenly Drive.<br><br>"I think getting one Golden Tablet here should be enough."<br><br>***<br><br>Milland held a small banquet to celebrate Raon's return and the destruction of the monsters without any casualties.<br><br>"It's been so long since we've had a rest."<br><br>"Thanks to Lord Raon."<br><br>"Wow, I've never seen swordsmanship like that. I can't believe we're both swordsmen."<br><br>"That swordsmanship. It wasn't like that before. Did it have about ten petals?"<br><br>"So he's been developing it continuously? That's even more impressive?"<br><br>The knights, rangers, and soldiers had put down their weapons and were enjoying small moments of happiness with drinks in hand. Of course, their main topic of conversation was Raon and his swordsmanship.<br><br>-Kiaaah!<br><br>Wrath let out an exclamation of pure joy.<br><br>-A buffet right as we arrive! So there are days when you actually prove useful!<br><br>He wagged his tail in approval.<br><br>'L-let's stop eating. I feel like my stomach's going to burst.'<br><br>Raon shook his head while touching his bloated stomach.<br><br>-Then just eat the pineapple pizza for the last bite! I want to taste my homeland's flavor after so long!<br><br>Wrath reached out, telling him to grab the last slice of pizza.<br><br>'We eat this all the time at home... Huh?'<br><br>Raon sighed and walked toward the pizza, but a Habun Castle knight ate the last slice in one bite and left.<br><br>-Kuuugh!<br><br>Wrath screamed while clutching his head.<br><br>-The most delicious last piece, taken by such a fellow!<br><br>He howled, saying he couldn't accept this.<br><br>-Catch him! Catch him and twist his body!<br><br>Wrath grabbed Raon's hair, demanding revenge for the pizza.<br><br>'Please maintain some dignity as a monarch! You hothead!'<br><br>Raon grabbed Wrath's head in return and shook it.<br><br>"Huh?"<br><br>Dorian tilted his head as he watched Raon frozen in front of the empty plate.<br><br>"If you want pizza, just ask the manager. He'll make it right away."<br><br>He smiled, saying it wouldn't take long.<br><br>"Sorry, but pineapple pizza might be difficult."<br><br>Yua's grandfather waved his hand.<br><br>"We're out of pineapples, so we can't make it."<br><br>He turned his gaze as if asking if they'd like regular pizza instead.<br><br>"Ah-ha!"<br><br>Dorian approached Yua's grandfather while brushing his forehead.<br><br>"It hurts my feelings when you say that with me right here!"<br><br>He poured out ten large pineapples from his pouch.<br><br>"Th-this..."<br><br>"It's a necessity!"<br><br>Dorian thumped his chest, saying to let him know if they needed any other ingredients.<br><br>"Ah, now it really feels like you've all returned."<br><br>Yua's grandfather broke into a bright smile as if recalling old memories.<br><br>"Now that we have the ingredients, I'll make it right away!"<br><br>He told them to wait a bit and went into the kitchen.<br><br>"I'll help!"<br><br>"M-me too!"<br><br>When Yua headed to the kitchen, Julius followed right behind her like a shadow.<br><br>'Nothing's changed.'<br><br>Raon wore a gentle smile.<br><br>'Everyone's exactly the same as before.'<br><br>When even Dorian stepped up talking about necessities, memories came flooding back like a painted picture. A soft smile unconsciously bloomed on his face.<br><br>"Raon. When are you leaving?"<br><br>Evelyn approached with her fingers wrapped around a wine glass. Though it was cheap alcohol, in her hands it looked like the most precious wine in the world.<br><br>"When did I say I was going anywhere?"<br><br>Raon narrowed his eyes as he looked at Evelyn.<br><br>"You wouldn't have come here without a reason. You must have another purpose."<br><br>Evelyn curled her lips, indicating she knew everything about him.<br><br>"...I really can't fool you."<br><br>Raon shook his head with a sigh.<br><br>"I'm planning to leave around noon tomorrow after checking the situation here."<br><br>"Noon? Got it."<br><br>Evelyn flashed a chilling smile that clearly indicated she'd definitely be going with him, then went to get more food.<br><br>"Tomorrow at noon. Understood."<br><br>Dorian nodded as if making a mental note.<br><br>[No, not tomorrow at noon, we're leaving at dawn today.]<br><br>Raon sent an aura message to Dorian.<br><br>[What? Oh-oh, understood.]<br><br>Dorian glanced at Evelyn's back and nodded.<br><br>-So you've finally grown tired of that crazy woman too!<br><br>Wrath nodded as if he'd expected this.<br><br>-Good thinking! Nobody can handle that madwoman!<br><br>'That's not it...'<br><br>Raon grabbed his temple as he thought about Evelyn's past behavior.<br><br>'If I take Evelyn along, she'll probably end up fighting with Sloth.'<br><br>He decided to leave her behind because she might try to forcefully wake Sloth up and cause a huge fight.<br><br>-True, that one throws a massive fit if his sleep is disturbed.<br><br>Wrath furrowed his brow, suggesting that even he would have trouble stopping Sloth if he truly got angry.<br><br>'That's why I'm a bit worried.'<br><br>Raon exhaled heavily as he looked north where white fog was gathering.<br><br>'What on earth has happened?'<br><br>***<br><br>Just past midnight, at dawn. Raon stood facing Dorian under a tree below the castle walls.<br><br>"We'll be running all the way to the Sterlin Mountains, so prepare yourself well." <br><br>He stretched his ankles and wrists while saying they wouldn't stop until reaching the Sterlin Mountains.<br><br>"Ah, then wear these."<br><br>Dorian pulled out fur-lined boots from his pouch.<br><br>"It's an artifact that increases movement speed on snow and ice. A winter necessity."<br><br>He smiled, saying he'd brought them just in case and it seemed like a good decision.<br><br>"Can't argue with that. A true necessity indeed."<br><br>Raon smiled faintly as he changed into the boots.<br><br>"But where are we going and what are we doing?"<br><br>Dorian blinked curiously.<br><br>"We're going to wake up a sleepyhead. You'll have a lot to do."<br><br>Raon grabbed Dorian's shoulder, saying he was counting on him.<br><br>"This feels a bit ominous..."<br><br>Dorian's eyes trembled like a child hit by snow, seeming uneasy.<br><br>"Don't worry. There won't be any danger."<br><br>Raon patted Dorian's back encouragingly before running north.<br><br>"L-let's go together!"<br><br>Dorian gasped and chased after Raon. Whoosh! With their increased martial prowess and the speed-enhancing artifacts they wore, they reached sight of the Sterlin Mountains in incomparably less time than before.<br><br>'That mountain hasn't changed either.'<br><br>Raon was smiling as he surveyed the Sterlin Mountains with their eternal snow.<br><br>-Hmm?<br><br>Wrath raised his eyes with a low groan.<br><br>'What's wrong?'<br><br>-A powerful impact occurred on that mountain.<br><br>'A powerful impact?'<br><br>Raon extended his aura perception, tilted his head for a while, then suddenly opened his eyes wide.<br><br>'I-I felt it too.'<br><br>Though much later than Wrath, he too could feel the impact that had burst from the Sterlin Mountains. For waves this powerful to be felt from such a distance, there must be a Transcendent involved.<br><br>"Dorian. It's okay to be late. Just follow properly."<br><br>"Huh? What do you..."<br><br>"I'm going ahead."<br><br>Raon executed the Supreme Harmony Steps at full power, his steps threatening to shatter the white earth. Whoosh! He rushed toward the Sterlin Mountains, breaking through space in a world where snow seemed frozen. Bang! Having reached a level where he could alter reality with his willpower, he arrived at the mountain's entrance in what seemed like an instant.<br><br>'Right. Two Transcendents clashed here.'<br><br>Though he didn't know who they were, it was clear that a massive impact had occurred at the center of the Sterlin Mountains.<br><br>'Sloth's barrier is still intact.'<br><br>Seeing that Sloth's barrier, which had started from the mountain's middle, remained unchanged, it seemed he was unharmed.<br><br>-I can't sense Sloth's power. Seems he's still sleeping.<br><br>'That's a relief.'<br><br>Raon sighed in relief as he climbed to the peak of the Sterlin Mountains. But just as he was about to look down at the frozen lake where Sloth should have been sleeping, his entire body froze. Rumble! Sloth, whom he'd naturally assumed would be sleeping, had torn apart the blanket he'd been given and raised his darkly burning eyes.<br><br>"It was... you?"<br><br>The Demon King of Sloth rose his creaking body, emanating authority powerful enough to crush the world.<br><br>"The one who... woke me up?"</p>
